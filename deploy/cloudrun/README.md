# MCP server on Google Cloud Run (primary)

Cloud Run is the primary host for the MCP server. It won on the two things every
other option tripped on:

- **Autoscaling that actually scales.** Load-tested to **c=100 at p50 ~2s, ~0%
  errors** (Cloudflare Containers thrashed at any real concurrency on a beta
  account limit; Vercel was memory-capped). Heavy `count(DISTINCT)` over 25.7M
  rows returns in ~7s.
- **A real warm floor.** `--min-instances=N` keeps N instances warm — set it 0
  normally (scale to zero, no idle cost) and bump it the morning of an event.

Same image as `deploy/cloudflare/` — the Dockerfile is platform-agnostic, so this
just points `gcloud` at it. 16 GiB RAM (`SPICY_REGS_MEMORY_LIMIT=12GB` leaves
headroom); `/tmp` spill is RAM-backed on Cloud Run, so RAM is the real ceiling.

## Deploy

```bash
gcloud auth login
PROJECT=spicy-regs-mcp ./deploy/cloudrun/deploy.sh
```

`SPICYREGS_DOMAIN` selects the MCP smoke-test hostname and the runtime domain.
It defaults to `spicy-regs.dev`; set it to `spicygov.ai` for Mike's fork.
`SPICY_REGS_R2_URL`, then `R2_PUBLIC_URL`, override the derived data URL;
`SMOKE_BASE` still overrides the smoke-test target. See [domain setup](../public-domain.md).

The script enables APIs, ensures the Artifact Registry repo, builds+pushes the
image (amd64), and deploys. It prints the service URL.

## Two one-time hurdles we hit (documented so you don't rediscover them)

1. **Billing quota.** Linking a *new* project to the Primary billing account
   failed with `Cloud billing quota exceeded` (cap on projects per billing
   account). Fix: bill `spicy-regs-mcp` to the **secondary** billing account, or
   free a slot / use an existing billing-enabled project.
2. **Org policy blocks public access.** The kvec.ai org enforces
   `iam.allowedPolicyMemberDomains` (Domain Restricted Sharing), so `allUsers`
   can't be granted `run.invoker` and the service 403s. Fix (needs org-policy
   admin, via Console): IAM & Admin → Organization Policies → *Domain restricted
   sharing* → Manage policy → Override parent's policy → **Allow All** → Save.
   Scoped to this project only. Then the deploy's `allUsers` binding succeeds
   (allow ~1 min for propagation).

## Event day

```bash
gcloud run services update spicy-regs-mcp --region us-east1 --min-instances 5   # warm floor
# ... after the event ...
gcloud run services update spicy-regs-mcp --region us-east1 --min-instances 0   # back to scale-to-zero
```

## Status — this IS the canonical endpoint

- **Custom domain** — `mcp.spicy-regs.dev` maps to the service (Cloud Run domain
  mapping; DNS in Cloudflare, managed cert). Done.
- **Iceberg catalog** — `R2_CATALOG_TOKEN` in Secret Manager + the `R2_CATALOG_*`
  vars, so `comments` reads the deduped system-of-record (verified: `count(*)` ==
  `count(DISTINCT comment_id)`). Done.
- **Vercel** — retired: the deploy workflow and the `mcp-server/api/index.py`
  copy are gone; `spicy_regs.mcp_server` is the single source.

> Parquet is served `no-cache` (edge caching corrupts DuckDB range reads — see the
> r2.py policy). The Cloudflare cache rule for the corpus is disabled; only
> non-parquet artifacts are cache-eligible.
