"""Transform: build ``lobbying_filings.parquet`` from the Senate LDA REST API.

Produces the family's public tables; it writes no per-row ETL receipts (ss-vse3: every
table's installed policy is marked ``receipts_retired``). A row's evidence is the run's
journal and the LDA pages it retained. ``lobbying_filings`` is keyed by ``filing_uuid``,
with ordered native activity and entity arrays.
``lobbying_activities`` holds one row per activity a filing reports, keyed
``(filing_uuid, activity_index)``. ``lobbying_activity_lobbyists`` holds one row
per lobbyist an activity names, keyed ``(filing_uuid, activity_index,
lobbyist_index)`` (owner decision 47). An index is the position in the filing's
own list: LDA never edits a filing, since an amendment is a new filing, so the
positions are stable. The lobbyists were dropped before, so history is read
once, with the shape that keeps them. ``lobbying_foreign_entities``,
``lobbying_affiliated_organizations`` and ``lobbying_conviction_disclosures``
hold the filing's other source lists the same way, keyed by ``filing_uuid``
and the entry's position (owner round 8 Q1, 2026-10-31).

Incremental by design (mirrors ``build_federal_register``): a full re-fetch of
the multi-million-row LDA archive every run would be wasteful *and* would trip
the R2 catastrophic-shrink guard on any short run. Instead we:

1. Select each table the captured index pins (``SelectedInputs``: its public table).
2. Fetch only filings posted since the filings table's max ``dt_posted`` (minus a
   short overlap to catch late-posted / amended filings).
3. Map the fetched window to the public columns and upsert it over each table on
   its key (``native_merge.upsert_subjects``): a fetched row replaces the prior row
   of its key, every other prior row is carried as published.

With no prior table (first run) step 2 becomes a full backfill. The reader is
functional keyless, so this runs in CI with or without ``LDA_API_KEY``.

    Every row must carry a nonempty ``filing_uuid`` — the merge identity — so a
    malformed row refuses instead of landing a NULL key in the published table.
    The owner's walk already refuses a changed declared count, an observed
    total disagreeing with it, or a page bound reached before the terminal
    page; a ``max_records`` stop is an explicit prefix of that walk and claims
    nothing about the rest.

    Agreeing with the declared count is not completeness. Offset paging over
    filings tied on ``dt_posted`` repeats one filing and skips another while
    serving exactly the declared total: the retained 1999 walk served its
    declared 31,498 records but 29,399 distinct filings, and lda.gov draws the
    order inside a tie afresh per request, so repeat walks skip different
    filings (ss-hqoi probe, 2026-10-30). A whole walk therefore goes through
    spicy-docs' ``pool_walks`` keyed by ``filing_uuid``: a clean walk (every
    walk since 2007 retained so far) settles in one pass, a tied one is walked
    again and pooled until it holds the declared total, and one still short
    after ``max_passes`` (default ``DEFAULT_POOL_PASSES``) raises
    ``IncompleteWalkError`` rather than publishing a short year. A 1999-2006
    year, whose filings are almost all posted on day-precision ties, lost 1.9%
    (2000) to 6.7% (1999) of its filings in one walk. The owner capped the
    1999-2006 re-walk at four passes (2026-10-31, ss-hqoi), the default; a year
    still short after four refuses and is reported, not published short. An
    unset ``LDA_POOL_PASSES`` means the default; zero or less is refused. One
    walk's filings are held in memory, as the whole-window read always was.
