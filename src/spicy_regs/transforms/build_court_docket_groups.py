"""Build ``court_docket_groups.parquet``: which published ``court_dockets`` rows are records of one case.

CourtListener can hold one case as several docket objects, and leaves its own ``parent_docket_id`` blank in every
row of the bulk editions. Two kinds are the publisher's own: a criminal case's per-defendant sub-dockets, which PACER
opens together under one docket number with consecutive case ids (its "doppeldocket" problem, FLP wiki, issue
#2185), and duplicate records of one filing, made when a record arrives with a different PACER case id for the same
number (its Docket is unique on docket number, PACER case id and court), an older docket object reused for a new case
among them.

Rule version 2, over one native bulk edition:

* Candidate groups are the native records sharing a published row's ``(court_id, docket_number)``; only records in
  the published selection are members, so every representative resolves in ``court_dockets``.
* Every member must be the same case as the member with the longest caption, under :func:`same_case`, the test the
  APA enrichment admitted sibling records with. A key that fails it holds a reused number and stays ungrouped.
* A member's PACER case id is *in sequence* when it lies within 10% of the median id of its court's dockets
  numbered within five serials of it (same office, year and type): CM/ECF assigns the serial and the case id
  together. Appellate numbers have no serial, so their keys have no sequence.
* The representative row has the lowest in-sequence id; with none in sequence, the lowest numeric id (rule 1's
  choice). Ties go to the lower ``cl_docket_id``.
* The tier is :data:`PER_DEFENDANT_DOCKETS` when a member carries ``federal_defendant_number`` or the ids the
  representative was chosen from run consecutively with at most :data:`MAX_MISSING_IDS` missing (rule 1's "spread at
  most five" for a pair); otherwise :data:`DUPLICATE_RECORDS`.

Rule 1 (2026-09-23) grouped identical captions only, took the lowest numeric id even where it was a reused or foreign
object's, and called a wide id spread ``refiled``, which a key of court and number cannot observe: 54 of its 55
``refiled`` groups had one filing date, and 11 parents lay outside their court's sequence (round-6 audit, M5).

Membership and neighbour ids come from one filtered scan of the native edition with Python-side set logic, the pattern
the enrichment used after a DuckDB parallel-join anomaly.
