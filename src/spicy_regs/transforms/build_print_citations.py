"""Build activity reports, budget volumes, bill actions and citations in one pass.

Publishes ``house_activity_reports``, ``budget_volumes``,
``bill_committee_actions`` and ``document_citations`` (in that order) from
GovInfo's CRPT and BUDGET collections. SpicyDocs owns selection, rendition
preference, interpretation and row shapes; this host owns the issue-date
window, caps, prior-output resume and publication.

The whole published window is enumerated each run so unsuccessful packages
remain eligible, and held packages are revisited when a reading input changes
(:func:`_processing_versions`); an unchanged source with successful matching
checkpoints across all its outputs costs no body requests. Outstanding packages
are read most-needed first (:func:`_queue`), and collections share the package
cap round-robin so neither starves on a cold start. Print families read the
package's PDF-first order because their columns state pages; bodies are read whole and
``read_depth`` reports the publisher's stated extent against pages actually
extracted. The two keyless chamber rosters supply the committee vocabulary — a
roster failure leaves its names unresolved, while access refusals abort.
Senate expenditure granules use a separate acquisition pass
(:mod:`spicy_regs.transforms.build_senate_expenditures`).
