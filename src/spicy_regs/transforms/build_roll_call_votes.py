"""Build roll-call and member-vote tables from complete source enumerations.

Each chamber's own session listing determines which votes to acquire: the
Clerk's roll files for the House, which spicy-docs probes forward from the
session's largest held roll (the EVS index pages answer 404 since 2026-10-02),
and the LIS vote menu for the Senate. Both hosts are keyless, so the rollup
needs no credential. Each chamber is listed on its own: a chamber whose
listing refuses leaves the run's scope, its held rows stay as published (as in
a ``ROLL_CALL_CHAMBERS`` run of the other), the refusal is journaled, and the
run builds the other chamber and then fails (:class:`ChamberListingRefused`),
so one publisher's outage neither blocks the other's roll calls nor passes
quietly. A refusal still never establishes a zero-vote session.

Two statements link a roll call to a bill, and ``match_rule`` names the one
that did: the bill family's recorded references (the bill's own action records
the vote) and the vote file's own statement of its measure (spicy-docs ``read_vote_file_statement``:
the Clerk's legis-num, the Senate's document or amended document). The bill's
action wins; where two bills' actions record one vote, the one the file names
wins, since positions in two different bills' action lists do not compare; with
no recorded reference the file links alone. An unlinked procedural vote still
has its own tally and member positions. House action references may add keys
before the Clerk's roll files catch up; Senate references alone never establish a complete
Senate selection.

A held row is relinked from its own columns, never refetched: ``legis_num`` for
the House, ``documents_json``/``amendments_json`` for the Senate. A House row
published before ``legis_num`` or ``clerk_body_element`` existed is not held
until it carries both, so each is read again once and gains the file's voting
body element and ``vote_desc`` with them.

House files before 2003 (the 101st-107th Congresses) name no legislator by
bioguide id; spicy-docs reads them with ``name:`` member keys and NULL
``bioguide_id``, a key that identifies the row within its roll call and never a
person (``member_vote_terms`` leaves such a row ``unresolved_member``). A
Senate file names its members by LIS id alone; after the ``member_votes``
merge, the published ``members`` crosswalk fills each row's ``bioguide_id``
through it (``table_merge.fill_senate_bioguide_ids``), best-effort, held rows
included, so the base table carries the id its column promises and
``member_vote_terms`` reads it rather than resolving again. A vote
the House vacated before recording a position publishes its row with
``member_vote_count`` 0 and no member rows. The Clerk's archive begins in
1990, so the 101st Congress's first session has no House roll files and is not
asked for (:data:`CLERK_FIRST_YEAR`). ``ROLL_CALL_CHAMBERS`` narrows a dispatch
to one chamber, and ``ROLL_CALL_MAX_VOTES`` sets its per-run cap
(:func:`max_votes_from_env`), so the 101st-107th House backfill is a bounded,
resumable dispatch: newest first, each held roll call never fetched again.

Congress.gov's ``house-vote`` listing was retired as a second linkage source
(2026-09-26): over the 115th-119th it listed exactly the Clerk index's 5,079
House roll calls, won no published link and changed no conflict count, and
linked only 115-1-527 and -528 (H.R. 3354), which the Clerk files state as
their own ``legis-num``. Receipt:
``~/Work/corpora/fork-execution-2026-09-21/votes-backfill-2026-09-26/keyless/``.

Acquisition is bounded by MAX_VOTES_PER_RUN. Unseen keys precede held correction
refreshes so a small cap cannot stall backfill. OVERLAP_VOTES applies separately
to each chamber of a sitting Congress; a closed Congress's held roll calls are
never re-read, so a backfill reads each once and the scheduled scope never
reaches them. All keys retain the publisher's chamber namespace. A successful
reacquisition replaces that roll call's complete member roster. Failed, capped
or unselected roll calls retain their prior observations; a held one published
before ``vote_day`` existed gains it from its own ``vote_date`` before the merge.
A held roll call's derived bill link changes only when the bill family's
recorded references name it; without that input its published link stands.
