#: ``parts`` is this repository's own rule for reading a report: every part
#: its record states, one row each, a package's rows replaced as a set
#: (decision 29). ``per-part-001`` replaced ``held-001``, which held out a
#: report read at its part 1's stem, so every CRPT checkpoint reads once more.
#: The re-read corrects what the backfill cannot: a row published before
#: ``part_id`` is kept as ``(package_id, package_id)``, right for a report in
#: one part, but CRPT-119hrpt811's Part-1 row (published 2026-09-24) becomes
#: ``(CRPT-119hrpt811-pt1, 1)``, and CRPT-119hrpt494 gains its Part 2 and part
#: numbers, only when read again.
#:
#: ``body`` is this repository's rule for a body's text, in both collections:
#: ``placeholder-pdf-001`` reads the PDF a part offers in place of the
#: publisher's placeholder text, publishes ``body_completeness`` and
#: ``text_derivation``, and gives a PDF-derived report's sections their pages.
#: ``placeholder-pdf-002`` (spicy-docs 0.33.2) also knows the notice spelled
#: without "IN", which CRPT-119hrpt649 and CHRG-119jhrg60491 print, so every
#: body read under 001 is read again.
#: ``code`` is the installed SpicyDocs' code and data (:func:`spicy_docs_code`),
#: which derives a report's text and sections; it replaced the release string,
#: under which every one of the stack's version-only releases re-read all 141
#: reports for rows differing only in ``observed_at`` (708f2bf4 against 95810b26).
#: CHRG also moves with ``HEARING_BILL_LINK_RULE_VERSION`` (the date correction
#: moved it). Admitting the two historical CHRG volumes to the package grammar
#: needs no token: no checkpoint names either, so there is nothing to re-read,
#: and only discovery can select them.
