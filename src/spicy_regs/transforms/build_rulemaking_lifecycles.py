"""Transform: build the rulemaking-lifecycles rollup (Proposed→Rule pairing).

Replaces the multi-CTE self-join over ``documents.parquet`` that the browser ran
on the agency profile / lab panels. Bakes both shapes the UI needs into one
artifact, discriminated by a ``kind`` column, for **all** agencies (the UI
filters by agency and slices its own samples/percentiles client-side):

* ``kind = 'pair'``  — completed rulemakings: the earliest Proposed Rule paired
  with the earliest matching Rule for the same docket, with the completion
  ``days``. Powers the per-agency duration percentiles, the completed strip-plot
  sample, and the government-wide benchmark.
* ``kind = 'stuck'`` — Proposed Rules with no matching Rule in the docket
  (``final_date``/``days`` NULL). The UI derives ``days_open`` from
  ``proposed_date`` live and applies its own age-window + tier sampling.

Bounded to ``proposed_date >= 2010`` (matching the browser floor); otherwise
date-independent, so it does not need a daily rebuild for correctness.
