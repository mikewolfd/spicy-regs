"""Compose several transforms into one, applied left-to-right.

``Chain(a, b)`` is the record-stream equivalent of ``b(a(records))`` — each
transform's lazy output stream feeds the next, so the chain buffers nothing.
Used by pipelines that need more than one shaping step per record type (e.g.
flatten *then* enrich) while ``stage_agencies`` still takes a single
``Transform`` per record type.
