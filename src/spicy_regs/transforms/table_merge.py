"""Shared merge helper for incremental, deduplicated Parquet tables.

Every rollup that ingests an external source and republishes an incremental
table follows the same three steps: best-effort download the prior published
table from R2, dedup the union of prior + freshly fetched rows on an identity
key (preferring the fresh row), and order the result by a version column. This
is that step, parameterised over the column tuple, identity and version column
so a table with any key shape can use it. A table stored as several files runs
the same step once per partition it touches (:func:`merge_partitioned_table`).

    """Merge the fresh ``new_file`` over a local prior on one identity column.

    The shared idiom behind the ingest rollups: union the prior file (when it
    exists — the caller already downloaded it where it downloads one) with the
    fresh rows, keep the fresh row on a repeated identity, refuse a NULL
    identity, and publish ordered by ``order_by`` with small row groups for
    scoped reads. One scan per side, deduplicated once, instead of one
    hand-rolled copy per rollup. A composite ``identity`` names its columns in
    order; only the first must be non-NULL (a SAM registration's EFT indicator
    is usually NULL, and NULLs partition together).

    ``retire`` is a SQL predicate over prior rows, for a caller whose fresh rows
    are the complete population of a slice: a prior row it holds TRUE for is
    dropped before the union, so what the slice no longer contains is retired.
    A row it holds NULL for is kept.

    ``derived`` maps an output column to a SQL expression over ``columns``,
    appended after them and recomputed from every merged row each run, so a
    prior row gains it and it never drifts from the columns it reads.

    A column the prior lacks is selected as NULL, as :func:`merge_table` does,
    so appending a column is a NULL backfill on the published rows, not a
    migration. ``renamed`` maps an output column to the name a published prior
    spells it with: a prior holding that name and not the new one reads it as
    the new column, so a rename carries the prior's own values and never needs
    the source read again.

    :func:`spicy_regs.sources.r2.download`) and ``rows``, deduplicated on
    ``identity`` (every identity column must be non-null; the fresh row wins
    over the prior one on a repeated identity), ordered by ``version_column``
    descending then ``identity`` — or by ``identity`` alone when
    ``version_column`` is ``None``, which is how the two contracts with no
    freshness axis (``section_diff_items``, ``financial_changes``, both ordered
    by a sequence number within their parent) publish.
    ``columns`` becomes an all-VARCHAR Arrow schema, so callers coerce before
    calling. An absent prior table (first run, or ``download_prior`` returning
    ``False``) degrades to publishing ``rows`` alone, which is a full backfill,
    not an error.

    A prior table missing some of ``columns`` is also not an error: each absent
    column is selected as a VARCHAR NULL, so appending a column to a contract
    is a NULL backfill on the rows already published rather than a migration.
    ``congress_bills`` is the live case — its first ten columns are frozen
    because other repositories pin that prefix by digest, and the bill family
    appends the rest.

    ``coalesce_prior``: merge column-wise instead of row-wise. The default
    (``False``) is row replacement — a fresh row wins whole, and a NULL in it
    is a real value that overwrites. Set it when a table holds **rows from two
    sources that state different column subsets**, where a fresh NULL means "I
    do not populate this column" rather than "this is now empty": the merge
    becomes a FULL OUTER JOIN on the identity emitting ``COALESCE(fresh,
    prior)`` per column, except where :data:`COALESCE_RULES` names a column's
    own rule. Without it, a narrower row does not merely NULL the other
    source's columns, it *drops* them, and the loss is small enough that the R2
    shrink guard (0.5) does not notice. :func:`merge_contract_table` sets the
    flag for ``congress_bills`` alone.

    ``prior_present``: pass ``False`` when the caller already tried
    :func:`prior_scratch_path` and knows the prior is absent, skipping a second
    ``download_prior`` call for the same known-absent object; ``True`` or the
    default ``None`` leave the disk-then-download behavior unchanged.

    ``replace_parents`` names a parent column and the successfully evaluated
    parent IDs: remove their prior relationship rows before merging, including
    when their fresh result is empty, while unread or failed parents keep their
    rows. A tuple of column names and a collection of matching value tuples
    replaces composite scopes, such as one file within one package, without
    modifying the retained prior file before the merge succeeds.

    ``backfill_prior`` maps a column to another column of the same table whose
    value a prior row takes where its own is NULL or absent. It exists for a
    column appended to the identity: the NULL-fill above would leave that part
    of every prior row's identity NULL, and the identity test would then drop
    every prior row without a word. The committee-report tables are the case:
    ``{"part_id": "package_id"}`` spells a row published before
    ``(package_id, part_id)`` as the package's one part (decision 29). It is
    applied in the prior's select, before the identity test and alongside
    ``replace_parents``.

    ``parquet_metadata`` writes processing checkpoints in the same artifact as
    the rows, including a successful read producing zero rows; callers supply
    the complete metadata to retain, it is not inferred from row presence.

    ``prior_constants`` gives a column the prior lacks one value on every prior
    row instead of NULL: a split table's partition column, which every row of
    one partition holds by construction (:func:`merge_partitioned_table`).

#: on a row this run did not touch. Delivery decision 1 (2026-09-22) accepts inherited URLs only
#: with this label. ``update_date`` keeps the larger value, as the contract's column sentence
#: says: a fresh read that states an older stamp than the one published never moves the row
#: backwards, and a same-day date-only value (the list route's) loses to BILLSTATUS's instant,
#: which sorts after it. Only when both sides have one of :data:`UPDATE_DATE_SHAPE`'s two shapes
#: is VARCHAR order time order, so only then is ``GREATEST`` taken; any other value on either
