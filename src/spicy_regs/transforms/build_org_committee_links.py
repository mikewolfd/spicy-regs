"""Transform: build ``org_committee_links.parquet``, the commenter-organization ↔ FEC committee name bridge.

Materializes the bridge ``docs/index.md`` describes but nothing implemented —
organization name links ``lobbying_filings``, ``fec_committees`` and comment
filers where no shared id exists — once, instead of every consumer re-inventing
its own normalization, and shows its work in ``match_method`` / ``confidence`` so
a consumer can pick a precision bar.

**Grain.** One row per (``organization`` string as filed on a comment,
``committee_id``); the org string is reused across comments and so is the unit
of resolution, and it joins straight back to ``comments.organization``.

**Matching.** Both sides are normalized the same way (uppercase, drop
parenthetical asides and apostrophes, ``&`` → ``AND``, punctuation → space),
then the committee side is stripped of PAC decorations (``... POLITICAL ACTION
COMMITTEE``, ``... PAC``, ...) to recover the sponsoring organization's name.
Three tiers, strongest first: ``exact`` (full normalized names equal), ``core``
(decoration-stripped cores equal), ``prefix`` (the committee core *starts with*
the whole organization core on a token boundary, matched by equality against
pre-generated committee token prefixes rather than a ``LIKE`` nested loop,
which would be ~1.3B comparisons).

**Fan-out is a signal, not an error.** One organization legitimately matching
many committees is usually a real affiliate network (*Planned Parenthood* hits
~90 state affiliate committees, SEIU ~16 locals, IBEW ~15), so rows are never
truncated: each carries ``committee_match_count`` and a ``confidence`` that
degrades with fan-out.

**Junk guards.** A core must be ≥ :data:`MIN_CORE_LENGTH` chars and ≥
:data:`MIN_CORE_TOKENS` tokens (which also blocks bare acronyms like ``NRDC``),
and must not be a :data:`GENERIC_ORG_CORES` entry; the blocklist matches the
*whole* core only, so blocking ``NEW MEXICO`` still leaves ``NEW MEXICO CATTLE
GROWERS ASSOCIATION`` free to match.

**Coverage is small by upstream reality, not a bug.** ``comments.organization``
is populated on ~20.7K of ~25.8M comments (0.08%) — the field is only captured
when a submitter fills it in, and mass comment campaigns leave it blank — and of
the ~14.2K distinct strings, ~12.7K clear the guards and a few hundred resolve.
Most commenting organizations run no federal PAC, so a low match rate is the
correct answer rather than a matcher to tune harder; ``name_source`` is stamped
on every row so text-derived names added later (comment title, letterhead,
signature block) can arrive as extra rows without breaking consumers.

``comments.parquet`` is read from ``output_dir`` when present, otherwise
straight from the public R2 URL over ``httpfs`` so Parquet projection pushdown
fetches only the five named columns rather than the multi-GB table. Comment
rows are deduplicated on ``comment_id`` (newest ``modify_date`` wins), matching
the MCP server's ``comments`` view so counts here agree with counts there.
