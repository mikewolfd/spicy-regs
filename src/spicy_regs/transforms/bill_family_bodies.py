"""The bill family's body pass: each printing's text, sections and comparisons, apart from its status.

A printing is pending by its own state -- listed in ``bill_versions`` with no
processed body -- not because its bill's BILLSTATUS moved, so this pass reads
the printings the status pass listed (this run's and every earlier run's) and
never rebuilds a bill to reach one.

From the 113th Congress on, bodies come from GovInfo's BILLS bulk folders
(``spicy_docs.sources.congress.bulk_bills``), one ``(congress, bill_type)``
group at a time: both sessions' listings are read, and a folder's zip is
downloaded only when its listing names a printing this run needs -- a pending
printing, or a held neighbour whose document a new comparison needs -- and then
read once for all of them. A printing the zip refused, or the engine could not
parse, is remembered with the zip entry it was read at, so an unchanged zip is
not downloaded again for it. Before the 113th, and for a printing no listing
names, the per-package route (``PackageBodySource``) remains, under the run's
``max_version_fetches`` cap, newest Congress first. A package that route read
without a section tree, or whose record the publisher answered 404 or 410 for,
is remembered the same way: with the listing it was fetched from and, for a
tree, the bytes and the engine that refused them. It is not fetched again while
its listing and that engine are unchanged. Either route labels a printing by the
rendition it actually read.

Every bill with work is built by the provider's ``build_bill_printings``: the
newly read printings emit their rows, held neighbours take part in order and
comparison as context, and the rest are placeholders. So ``printing_order``,
``seq`` identity, numbered reprints and the repeated-printing refusal are the
provider's, applied exactly as the status pass applies them.

What is written scales with what was read: each bill built emits the rows of
the printings it read and of the comparisons they complete, and a listed
placeholder a body now stands for is retired, so a printing has one
``bill_versions`` row. The merge rewrites each table whole except
``bill_sections``, which is stored one file per Congress and rewrites only the
Congresses this run read.

Cost, with B bills with work, P pending printings, Q pending comparisons and F
BILLS folders naming a needed printing: planning is O(rows of the B bills)
over the prior index, never over every bill; the pass makes two listing
requests per ``(congress, bill_type)`` group with work and one zip download per
folder in F, decompresses and parses only the members it keeps (P plus the
held sides of Q), and diffs only the consecutive pairs that are new or missing.
Before, the status pass reached a body only by rebuilding its whole bill, at
three keyed requests a printing (summary, MODS, body) under a cap of 600 a run.
