"""Transform: build ``fr_docket_links.parquet``, the Federal Register ↔ docket link table.

One row per document–docket pair a dated Federal Register record states, in either of its two statements, carrying
the display columns the docket page needs, sorted by ``docket_id`` so ``WHERE docket_id = ?`` prunes row groups
instead of scanning (it replaced the ``docket_ids_json LIKE '%"<id>"%'`` full scan the docket page ran on every load):

- the labels the document prints: each element of ``docket_ids_json``, verbatim as ``docket_id``, one row per array
  occurrence (``docket_source_ordinal`` its position). The explosion keeps the old ``LIKE``'s matching semantics,
  including the quirk where a few array elements join two ids;
- the Register's regulations.gov link: ``regulations_dot_gov_docket_id``, never a docket read off a document id, as
  a row of its own only where no printed label carries it.

``link_source`` says which statement carries the pair: ``printed``, ``regulations_dot_gov_info`` or ``both``, where a
printed label is the Register's docket id or SpicyDocs' normalizer reads that id from it ("Docket No. FAA-2007-29334").
It is not part of a row's identity, so a pair both statements carry is one row, not two. A held Register row read
before the link was requested states no link (NULL), and adds none.
