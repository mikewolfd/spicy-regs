"""CourtListener opinion bodies as Markdown: one pass over the opinions export, written id-sorted in id blocks.

The export is in no id order (a median 2,000-record stretch spans 96% of the id range;
``work/court-text-measure-20261030/extrapolate.json``), so a streaming write cannot sort it, and staging the whole
export first is the 73 GB of scratch behind decision 6. So the build has two phases:

1. Read the export once (``CourtListenerLocalDump``), convert each record in a process pool
   (``spicy_docs.sources.courtlistener.opinion_markdown.select_source``) and spill the converted rows, partitioned by
   ``opinion_id // SPILL_WIDTH``, one file per bucket held open for the pass, at zstd 1, each row group about
   ``SPILL_GROUP_BYTES`` of Markdown. O(N) in the export. ``_complete.json`` marks the spill whole.
2. Walk the spill buckets in id order: read one, sort it by numeric id, and hand the sorted table to
   ``court_bulk.write_bundle``, which writes its subject rows and receipts in one pass into the member of its
   ``opinion_block`` (``court_opinion_texts/opinion_block=<k>/part-000000.parquet``), at zstd 12, row groups of at
   most ``ROW_GROUP_TEXT_BYTES`` of Markdown, statistics only on the short columns. O(N log B) for bucket size B.
   Each block's receipts are committed as one part; a failed run resumes at the first uncommitted block.

Peak memory is O(largest spill bucket) in phase 2; peak disk is the whole spill at the end of phase 1, shrinking as
phase 2 deletes each committed block's buckets while the members grow.

Readers compute a row's member from its id: ``opinion_block = opinion_id // OPINION_BLOCK_WIDTH`` (stored as decimal
text, as ``opinion_id`` is), so a point read names one member. The width is chosen from the whole 2026-06-30 export
(``lengths-full.parquet``, scaled by the 2026-10-30 Markdown size model): 76 blocks whose largest is projected at
0.84 GB. Spill buckets are a third of a block so the heaviest one (1.99 GB of source HTML) sorts in memory.

Receipts point at the converted value and never copy it: the export's file witness, the record's id and
``source_sha256`` (of the rendering converted), with the converter's identity in the diagnostics. A rendering the
converter refuses becomes a refused receipt carrying the same pointer, never an empty text.

A run bounded by ``max_rows`` reads the export's head, writes a ``bounded`` run receipt beside its output and never
selects or admits a generation.

Measured 2026-10-30 on the export's first 100,000 records (2.36 GB of renderings): 216 s wall, 124 s phase 1 and
92 s phase 2, process tree peak 6.7 GB RSS with 3 workers, 0.60 GB of spill, 75 members of 415 MB in all with
footers of about 0.9 KB per row group (about 440 KB at a full member's ~490 groups). A point read over HTTP takes 4
range requests on the member computed from the id, 6 through the whole member list with ``opinion_block`` filtered,
and 154 cold with only ``opinion_id`` filtered. On the same rows reshuffled, DuckDB's ``COPY ... ORDER BY`` with
``PARTITION_BY`` and ``ROW_GROUP_SIZE_BYTES`` was 8% faster than the spill and sort but wrote members out of id order
(byte-sized row groups need ``preserve_insertion_order=false``) with row groups of up to 54 MB of Markdown, so the
sort stays here. Export-order members with a sorted id index (the ``receipt_key_index`` pattern) skip the spill and
sort (1.1 GB peak RSS against 3.7 GB for the comparison's in-memory sort) at the same write time, but are 6% larger
and a point read takes 9 requests.

Re-measured on the same 100,000 rows fed in shuffled 500-row tasks (``work/scripts/phase2_compare.py``): the spill is
209 files of 808 row groups (``write_dataset`` without ``min_rows_per_group``: 11,916 files of 15,419 groups at a
256 open-file limit) for 0.29 GB of RSS over its input. Phase 2 spends 80% of its time in the zstd-12 member writes
(``ParquetWriter.write_table``); handing ``write_bundle`` the sorted table instead of a temporary file saved about 10%
of phase 2 for 0.5 GB more peak RSS (3.4 GB).

    A block is done once its receipt part is renamed into place; only then are its buckets deleted. So a failed run
    resumes at the first block without a part, and the spill shrinks as the members grow. The parts are joined into
    ``receipt_path`` (pointers only, about 156 B a row) once every block is done, then the refusals.
