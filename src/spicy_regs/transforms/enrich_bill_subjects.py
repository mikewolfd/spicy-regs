"""Transform: build ``bill_subjects.parquet`` — the Library of Congress subject assignment per bill.

Closes the seam the retired list writer left: list-level ``congress_bills``
rows carry no subject assignment (one ``policy_area`` from a ~33-term
controlled list, plus any number of legislative subjects). A sibling table rather than extra columns, because the two artifacts
have different writers and fetch economics; it publishes on its own cron, keyed
by the same ``bill_id`` as ``congress_bills``, joined with a one-line ``LEFT JOIN``.

**The Congress picks the route.** From the 108th (``BULK_STATUS_FLOOR``) the
assignment is BILLSTATUS's, read without a per-bill request:

* a bill whose ``congress_bills`` row the bill family filled from BILLSTATUS
  (``schema_version`` set) is copied from that row on every run, and its row
  here is rewritten only when the copy differs, so a policy area CRS assigns
  after the first run arrives with the family's next read;
* a bill in a folder (Congress and bill type) the family has read, whose own
  row is still list-level, waits for the family's next run rather than
  downloading the zip the family is about to read — while its Congress is the
  current or previous one. In an older Congress the family's read is settled,
  so such a bill is one whose file the reader refused, and it goes to the API;
* a bill in a folder the family has not read comes from that folder's bulk zip
  through spicy-docs, one request per folder, at most
  :data:`MAX_FOLDERS_PER_RUN` folders a run. A bill whose file the reader
  refuses (the superseded 1.0.0 schema) goes to the API instead.

Below the 108th only Congress.gov's ``/subjects`` holds it: one keyed request
per bill, at most :data:`MAX_API_BILLS_PER_RUN` a run; without a key those
bills stay pending.

**One deadline for the network.** No folder read and no API request attempt —
first page, later page or retry — starts :data:`DEADLINE_SECONDS` or more after
the run began; what it would have answered is left for the next run. One
already started runs to its own bound: a folder read to its budget, an API
request to its 60-second timeout.

**Incremental and resumable.** Best-effort prior from R2; apart from the
family's rows, a bill is pending while the prior has no row for it; newest
Congress first. Only an answer becomes a row: a failed folder, an API timeout,
or a bill missing from the current or previous Congress's zip (a folder that
may simply lag) writes nothing, so the bill is asked again next run. A bill an
older Congress's zip does not list, or the API answers 404 for, gets a row with
a null ``policy_area`` and its carrier, so it is not asked again. Prior and new
rows merge on ``bill_id``, preferring the fresh one.
