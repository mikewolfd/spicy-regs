"""Transform: build ``bill_subjects.parquet`` — one bill's subject assignment.

The seam this closes is stated in :mod:`~spicy_regs.transforms.build_congress_bills`:
``congress_bills`` is list-level only, and the Library of Congress subject
assignment (one ``policy_area`` from a ~33-term controlled list, plus any number
of ``legislative subjects``) is detail-endpoint-only. This is the per-bill
enrichment pass that fetches it, via
:class:`~spicy_regs.sources.bill_subjects.BillSubjectsFetcher`.

**Why a sibling table and not extra columns on ``congress_bills``.** The two
artifacts have utterly different fetch economics: the list ingest walks a handful
of pages a day, while enrichment is one request per bill across a 192k-row
archive. Folding them together would put a multi-week backfill inside a daily
30-minute job, and would give one R2 key two writers. So this publishes its own
artifact on its own cron, keyed by the same ``bill_id`` — the ``fr_docket_links``
shape, joined with a one-line ``LEFT JOIN``::

    SELECT b.*, s.policy_area, s.subjects_json
    FROM congress_bills b LEFT JOIN bill_subjects s USING (bill_id)

**Incremental, resumable, bounded.** Each run:

1. Best-effort downloads the prior ``bill_subjects.parquet`` from R2.
2. Selects bills in ``congress_bills.parquet`` that the current carrier has not
   answered for yet, newest Congress first, capped at :data:`MAX_BILLS_PER_RUN`
   so the run fits inside the CI timeout (the ``build_lobbying_filings``
   ``MAX_WINDOW_DAYS`` idea, counted in bills rather than days).
3. Fetches each, writing a row only when the carrier *answered*. A timeout or a
   5xx writes nothing, so the bill is simply picked up next run — no half-written
   state, and a re-run is never wasted work.
4. Merges prior + new on ``bill_id``, preferring the fresh row.

A bill the carrier definitively 404s gets a row with a null ``policy_area`` and
its carrier recorded, so the next run does not ask again. Should a key later
appear and switch the run to the deeper Congress.gov carrier, those rows *are*
re-asked — the carrier that had nothing is not the carrier that might.
