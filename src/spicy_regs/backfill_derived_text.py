"""Backfill comment ``text_content`` from Mirrulations derived-data extracted text.

The ETL fills ``text_content`` inline for *new* comments
(:class:`~spicy_regs.transforms.enrich_derived_text.EnrichCommentText`), but
every comment published before that wiring still has ``text_content`` NULL. This
is the one-time / re-runnable backfill: it fills ``text_content`` from the
bucket's ``derived-data`` prefix (no PDF download, no JSON re-ingest). By
default, rows are candidates only if they already carry an ``attachments_json``
and have no ``text_extraction_status`` yet, so repeated runs only do new work.

That default has a blind spot: comments ingested before the pipeline started
recording ``attachments_json`` never get a chance, even though Mirrulations may
already have extracted text for their attachments. Pass
``discover_from_derived=True`` (CLI: ``--discover-from-derived``) to select
candidates by ``text_extraction_status`` alone and let the derived-data listing
itself decide whether extracted text exists — this is strictly more expensive
(every docket in scope gets listed, not just ones already known to have
attachments) so scope it with ``--agency``/``--limit``.

There are two write targets, because comments now live in two places:

* **Catalog (``--use-iceberg``)** — the R2 Data Catalog (Iceberg) is the
  system of record. Under the Iceberg pipeline the public mirror is regenerated
  daily from the catalog (see :func:`spicy_regs.sources.iceberg.export_public_comments`),
  so a mirror-only backfill is transient — the next ``publish-comments-mirror``
  run overwrites it. This path upserts the filled rows straight into the catalog
  (one agency at a time, the DELETE+INSERT idiom of ``iceberg._merge``), so the
  fill survives. Run ``publish-comments-mirror`` afterwards to surface it.
* **Published Parquet (default)** — the pre-Iceberg, in-place path: it reads the
  already-published comment Parquet (monolith or the ``agency_code=<X>``
  partition tree) and writes it back. Kept for the legacy layout / local use.
  NB: under the live Iceberg pipeline this is *not durable* — prefer
  ``--use-iceberg``.

It is the derived-data sibling of :mod:`spicy_regs.enrich_pdf`: same incremental,
attachment-only shape, but the text source is Mirrulations' pre-extracted
``.txt`` rather than a downloaded PDF. A wrinkle the PDF path doesn't have: the
Hive comment partitions drop the ``agency_code`` column (it is encoded in the
``agency_code=<X>`` directory name), but the derived-data S3 path is keyed by
agency — so the partition walker (and the catalog path) supply the agency
explicitly; the monolithic ``comments.parquet`` still carries the column per row.

    candidate, and the per-docket derived-data listing (via
