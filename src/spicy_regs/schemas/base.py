    A RecordType pairs a name and primary key with a schema and an extract
    function that maps a raw payload (e.g. a parsed JSON dict) to a flat
    record dict matching the schema. Instances are values, not classes —
    contributors add new record shapes by constructing a new RecordType,
    not by subclassing.

    ``path_pattern`` is optional and source-specific: the Mirrulations S3
    reader uses it to locate this record type's files in the bucket. Sources
    that don't address records by path (e.g. an HTTP API) can leave it unset.
