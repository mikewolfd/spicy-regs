"""Convert one old-shape rollup family to native subjects and receipts, once, through that family's own writer.

A scheduled rollup refuses a published family that carries no ETL receipts (``selected_generations``), so a family
whose builder reads its own prior cannot convert itself. This command does it explicitly, one named family at a time:
the family's retained published tables stand in for its builder's output, its maintained writer splits them into
subjects and receipts, and the standard admission publishes them. No scheduled path gains an old-shape reader.

The receipt it writes keeps the captured index entry, and is saved before the pointer write is attempted, so
``--rollback`` can put the pointer back whatever became of the process. Without ``--publish`` nothing is written
outside the work directory. Runbook: ``docs/native-family-conversion.md``.
