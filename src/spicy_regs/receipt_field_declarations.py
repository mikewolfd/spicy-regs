"""What a table's ETL receipts hold inside a mapping, what each receipt-only field means, and which fields a
builder's read marker governs: the declaration ``read_receipt_fields`` reads, bundled as ``receipt_fields.json``.

Every entry is derived from a family's own field registry, a builder's own read rule or the dictionary's prose.
Those import pyarrow and spicy-docs, which the MCP server's image does not install, so ``spicy-regs-dict generate``
writes the bundle and ``check`` refuses a stale one. A table's declared receipt fields are not listed: the server
reads them from the installed policy at run time, and offers a field held in a mapping only while that policy still
declares the mapping, so a policy that stops keeping one takes its fields off offer without a rebuild of this file.
