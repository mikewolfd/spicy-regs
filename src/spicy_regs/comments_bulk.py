"""Bulk comments shaping with exact raw rows and row-writer fallback.

The shared regulations mapper remains the authority for attachment parsing and
HTML text. SQL handles pass-through fields, receipt encoding and hashing. Every
unsupported row goes back to the caller's reference writer in its source order.
The catalog retains one original source input per current row. Replacements
write the new input without embedding copies of earlier inputs. Verified
processing reads normalize that input through the maintained catalog mapper.
This module writes private files; catalog commits and publication stay with the
catalog owner.
