"""Generate and validate the Spicy Regs data dictionary.

The data dictionary has two layers:

* **Schema (source of truth, in code).** Column names and types come from
  :data:`spicy_regs.schemas.regulations.RECORD_TYPES` for the core tables, the
  spicy-docs contracts for the hosted tables, a builder's own column list or
  Arrow schema where it has one, and :data:`DERIVED_SCHEMAS` below for the
  rollups whose SQL is their only declaration. This keeps generation
  deterministic and offline.
* **Descriptions (curated prose).** Human descriptions live in
  ``data_dictionary/descriptions.yaml``, keyed by table and column.

``spicy-regs-dict check`` reconciles the two so they can't silently drift, and
``spicy-regs-dict generate`` renders one Markdown page per table for the MkDocs
site under ``docs/tables/``. ``generate`` also bundles the output ledger's
per-table audits (``output_ledger``), the declared cross-table joins
(``table_joins``) and what each table's receipts carry (``receipt_field_declarations``)
for the MCP server, and ``check`` refuses a stale copy of any.

Usage::

    uv run spicy-regs-dict check                 # offline: descriptions vs in-code schema
    uv run spicy-regs-dict check --source r2     # also reconcile in-code schema vs live R2 parquet
    uv run spicy-regs-dict generate              # (re)write docs/tables/*.md

#: The six kinds a coverage statement can be, as machine-readable tokens,
#: keyed by the prose prefix so the two cannot disagree.
#:
#: "Sampled" is the weakest population claim: the table is filled from a
#: bounded slice of the publisher's archive chosen by a per-run cap, not by a
#: date window, so neither an end-to-end range nor a window describes it. The
#: bill-family and roll-call tables open this way until a full run has been
#: measured, because calling a capped first pass a "Window" would state a
#: density it does not have. A capped table whose cap has caught up is
#: re-kinded only after the output ledger records the publisher's declared
#: count beside what is held (house_communications, 2026-10-03).
#:
#: "Empty" is a table that is declared and published with no rows, by owner
#: decision or because its producer is not enabled. The 2026-10-02 blind test
#: found six such tables reading "Sampled" or "Not a range", so a count over

#: word per table, stated in descriptions.yaml and carried into table_metadata.json; a relationship view
#: takes its base table's. GAO and CRS are oversight; SAM, USAspending, the President's budget and the

    support, not current availability, and is not exported here.

    ``measured_on`` is a manually maintained date attached to the coverage
    statement. Some statements describe source measurements, some describe
    local bounded runs, and some remain design statements. Read the associated
    prose and receipt to distinguish them. The date is neither a publication
    timestamp nor an automatic freshness or quality check.

    ``kind`` is the coverage statement's kind as a token. The prose still opens
    by naming it for a person, but a consumer must not have to parse a sentence
    to branch on it: the opening word carries a trailing period or comma
    depending on the phrasing, so a whitespace split fails on seven of the
    twenty-four classes.
