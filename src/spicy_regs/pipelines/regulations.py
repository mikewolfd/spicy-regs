"""The regulations.gov ETL, expressed through the Reader/Writer/Pipeline base classes.

This is also the run file. Invoke it via the ``run-pipeline`` console script::

    uv run run-pipeline --skip-upload --since-year 2025
    uv run run-pipeline --agency EPA --no-skip-upload

``RegulationsPipeline.run()`` reads top-to-bottom as the data flow:

    1. Prime      — load the incremental Manifest and existing output.
    2. Extract → stage  — ``stage_agencies`` fans agencies out in parallel; each
       record stream flows Mirrulations Reader (raw JSON) -> ExtractRecords
       transform (flatten) -> StagingWriter (local Parquet).
    3. Merge      — merge and deduplicate the per-agency staging Parquet in one
       whole-dataset transform.
    4. Load       — save the Manifest, then publish to R2 (``_publish``, which
       advances the manifest strictly last). Publishing stays off until this
       path is vetted; pass ``--no-skip-upload`` to turn it on.

The reusable pieces live elsewhere: connection details + the reader factory in
``sources.mirrulations``, the json→record transform in ``transforms.extract``,
the parallel fan-out in ``pipelines.staging``, R2 in ``sources.r2``, and
processed-key tracking in ``manifest``. This module is just the wiring.
