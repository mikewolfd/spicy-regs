"""The regulations.gov ETL, expressed through the Reader/Writer/Pipeline base classes.

This is also the run file: invoke it via the ``run-pipeline`` console script,
e.g. ``uv run run-pipeline --skip-upload --since-year 2025``. ``run()`` reads
top-to-bottom as the data flow: prime the incremental Manifest and existing
output, extract every agency's record streams in parallel into staging Parquet while
keeping each fetched original (``mirrulations_originals``), merge and
deduplicate the staging, then save the Manifest and publish to R2
(``_publish``, which advances the manifest strictly last). Publishing stays off
until this path is vetted; pass ``--no-skip-upload`` to turn it on. The
reusable pieces live elsewhere — connection details and the reader factory in
``spicy_docs.sources.mirrulations``, the json→record transform in
``transforms.extract``, the parallel fan-out in ``pipelines.staging``, R2 in
``sources.r2``, processed-key tracking in ``manifest`` — so this module is just
the wiring.

        Every agency's dockets and documents come first, in one pass that publishes
        them once; the batches then read comments only. The documents rode in the
        comment batches, which take about 74 minutes even with 10 new keys (run
        42769233858), so a sweep reached two or three of the 15 and on 2026-11-10
        twelve batches' documents still ended on 10-03. The pass lists every agency's
        whole prefix once (42 minutes for all 15 batches on 2026-10-03, run
        37147050861), and the same scan keeps each agency's unread comment keys: a
        comment batch reads those instead of listing its agencies again. A comment
        written after the pass waits for the next sweep; it is not in the manifest,
        so it is not lost. An agency the pass did not list (it failed) is listed by
        its batch. With ``only_comments`` the first pass is skipped; with
        ``skip_comments`` it is the whole sweep.

        A failure stops the sweep: continuing with uncommitted in-memory keys could
        retire a failed batch when a later batch publishes its manifest. A fresh
        runner resumes from the last durable checkpoint; final publication is separate.
        One exception: a dockets and documents pass that fails before recording any
        key is reported as an ``::error::`` annotation, the comment batches still run
        under the budget, and the sweep then raises so the run fails. Nothing of that
        pass is half-recorded: ``_run`` records keys only after their tables and retry
        state are published, the next pass builds in a new directory with new
        originals, and a hosted run restores retry state from the publication index.
        Evidence failures are never caught: a retention halt (``RetentionHalted``) or
        a refused commit of originals (``SourceEvidenceError``) stops the sweep.

        With ``budget_minutes``, a batch starts only while the time since the sweep
        began (the first pass included) plus an estimate for one more batch fits the
        budget. The estimate is the longest comment batch this process has completed,
        and at least ``SWEEP_BATCH_FLOOR_SECONDS``. A sweep that stops there returns
        the batch (0-indexed) it stopped before and writes it to ``SWEEP_STOPPED_NAME``;
        every batch before it is already committed, so the caller can exit cleanly
        and publish. ``None`` means every batch ran. The hosted limit killed run
        42674437011 (2026-11-09) inside its second batch and nothing was published.

        ``start_batch`` begins the round at that batch and wraps to the first, so a
        sweep that resumes where the last one stopped still visits every batch once.
        Sweeps that always began at the first batch would never reach the later ones.
        With ``resume``, the R2 ``SweepState`` overrides ``start_batch`` when it has
        one: each comment batch's start and finish are written there, so a run killed
        by the hosted limit or failed mid-batch resumes at that batch, not at 0. A
        batch started ``SWEEP_POISON_STARTS`` times in a row without finishing is
        skipped once, with an ``::error::`` line, and runs again at the end of the round.
