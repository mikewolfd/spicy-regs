"""Hosted refreshes of the source families that were refreshed by hand.

Each rollup acquires through its family pipeline's own capture functions with the run's source evidence, so
every downloaded byte is in that evidence and is uploaded to R2 before the family pointer moves: a hosted
runner has no shared raw archive, and its evidence is where its downloads are kept. A run that finds nothing
the published generation lacks raises :class:`Unchanged` and publishes nothing.
