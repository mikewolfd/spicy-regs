"""Base class for decoupled, per-rollup pipelines.

Each rollup (``feed_summary``, ``agency_stats``, ``rulemaking_lifecycles``, ...)
is materialized by its own :class:`RollupPipeline` subclass with its own console
entry (``run-rollup-*``) and its own GitHub Actions workflow on an independent
cron. This keeps rollup logic out of the extract/merge ETL: a rollup can be
re-run or backfilled on its own, and a failure is isolated to a single artifact.

``run()`` reads top-to-bottom as the data flow:

    1. Prime — download the base tables this rollup reads from R2 (skipping any
       already present locally, so local dev and re-runs don't re-download).
    2. Build — materialize the rollup artifact via a transform.
    3. Load  — publish the single artifact to R2 (shrink-guarded), off by
       default while vetting.

**Contract:** a rollup publishes exactly one independently schedulable artifact.
Its declared inputs are source snapshots, not outputs from a sibling rollup that
must run first. Cross-derived dependencies, prior state, or multi-artifact
publication belong to ``MaterializedDatasetPipeline`` instead.
