"""Rollup pipeline: sam_entities.parquet (SAM.gov Entity API v4 ingest).

Unlike the derived rollups, this one *ingests* an external source rather than
reading base tables from R2, so ``inputs`` is empty — the bounded fetch +
incremental merge with the prior published table happens inside
``build_sam_entities``. The base class still handles the shrink-guarded R2 upload
of the single output.

**Bounded, accretive scheduled run.** The active registry (~765K entities) is far
past the ~5K synchronous pagination ceiling, so full coverage comes from SAM's bulk
extract walked over ``registrationDate`` year windows (see
:mod:`spicy_regs.sources.sam_entities`). To keep each *scheduled* run bounded while
still converging on full coverage, the default run fetches a **single rotating
year window** (chosen from the run date), and the transform's merge accretes each
window into the prior table across runs. Over one rotation period every year is
covered; subsequent cycles refresh it.

**Full backfill / overrides** via env vars (read here so the shared rollup CLI stays
minimal):

- ``SAM_INGEST_MODE``   — ``extract`` (default) or ``partition``.
- ``SAM_SINCE_YEAR`` / ``SAM_UNTIL_YEAR`` — explicit registrationDate year range;
  set both to walk a range in one run (e.g. ``2000``..current for a full backfill).
- ``SAM_MAX_RECORDS``   — bound the run (blank/``0`` = unbounded).

A full backfill is therefore a single ``workflow_dispatch`` (or local) run with
``SAM_SINCE_YEAR=2000 SAM_UNTIL_YEAR=<current-year>`` and ``SAM_MAX_RECORDS`` unset.
