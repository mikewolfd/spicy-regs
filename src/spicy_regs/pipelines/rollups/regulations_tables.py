"""A regulations ingest that merges at its published table, with no per-row receipts (ss-vse3).

The Unified Agenda and CFR sections builders keep the text shape they have always written (``SOURCE_COLUMNS``) and
their own merge with the prior table. What changed is where the prior comes from and what is published: the prior
is the table the captured index pins, read back into that text shape (``regulations_shape.published_as_source``),
never restored through receipts; the builder's table is mapped once to the published columns
(``regulations_shape.mapped_table``) in the builder's order, ``ROW_GROUP_ROWS`` rows per group, and no receipt is
written. A column the receipts alone held is either public or derived: both tables' ``url`` is a fixed template of
their identity (measured equal on every row of the 2026-11-10 receipts), so the builders still write it and the
mapper leaves it out, as it always did.
