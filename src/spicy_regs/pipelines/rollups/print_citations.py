"""Rollup pipeline: house_activity_reports, budget_volumes, bill_committee_actions and document_citations.

Four outputs from one pass: the two GovInfo collections share an acquirer and
its pacing budget, and the citations and bill actions are read out of a
document body that is only in hand during the pass that fetched it.
``transforms/build_print_citations.py`` states why these four and not some
other grouping, and why ``senate_expenditures`` is a rollup of its own.
