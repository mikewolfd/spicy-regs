"""Re-read every Mirrulations comment once, keeping everything a later column decision could need (owner, 2026-09-28).

The catalog replaces a row only when its ``modify_date`` moves, and the manifest skips keys already read, so rows
ingested before a field was retained keep it NULL: the four comment-reference columns, ``subtype`` and
``duplicate_comments`` (``comment_fields_write.FILL_COLUMNS``), ``attachments_json`` wherever the row's first read
lacked the attachments, and the submitter's name, organization and category on every row read before the extract
mapped them (2026-06-15). One pass keeps, per object: its key and the GET's ETag and size; the whole thin-table row
through ``COMMENT.extract`` (one spelling), with the body as its SHA-256 and length; and every other stated attribute
as compact JSON (``attributes_json``: the keys the extract does not map, non-null only), which ``comment_attributes``
is built from.

Two phases, so the long read holds no lock and the catalog write holds it briefly:

* ``plan`` + ``read`` touch no catalog. ``plan`` splits the ETL manifest's comment keys into fixed chunks per agency;
  ``read`` fetches each chunk through the ETL's Mirrulations reader and writes one Parquet part per chunk. A part is
  written whole or not at all, so a rerun reads only the chunks that have no part, and a chunk with transport
  failures stays unwritten for the next run. Answers that are not transport failures (unreadable or empty objects)
  are kept in the chunk's journal line. A plan is named by the manifest digest and the record shape, so a changed
  shape is a new plan, never parts of two shapes stitched together.
* ``stage`` writes what ``prepare`` reads of the parts for one fill profile into one checked file a runner fetches
  (:func:`stage`, :func:`upload_staged`); ``prepare`` and ``write`` (``comment_fields_write``) then run under the
  catalog lock.
