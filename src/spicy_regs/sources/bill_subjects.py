"""One bill's CRS policy area and legislative subjects, and the Congress.gov fetch for bills BILLSTATUS cannot reach.

``congress_bills`` rows from the list route carry no subject signal, so
:mod:`spicy_regs.transforms.enrich_bill_subjects` publishes the assignment as a
sibling table. The Library of Congress assigns each bill one ``policyArea`` (a
~33-term controlled list) and any number of legislative subjects, and two
publishers serve those same assignments; the Congress decides which one answers:

``govinfo-billstatus``
    From the 108th Congress on, BILLSTATUS states both fields. The transform
    reads them from the bill family's own rows or from the folder's bulk zip,
    one request per Congress and bill type, never one per bill.

``congress-api``
    Below the 108th, only ``GET /v3/bill/{congress}/{type}/{number}/subjects``
    holds them, back to the 93rd Congress, when CRS began indexing legislation.
    It returns **both** fields in one response, so a bill costs one request
    until its subjects overflow a page. Requires an api.data.gov key, resolved
    through the same fallback chain as :mod:`spicy_regs.sources.congress_bills`
    and sent, like there, only as the ``X-Api-Key`` header, never in the URL.

**Three outcomes, not two.** :meth:`BillSubjectsFetcher.subjects_for` returns a
:class:`BillSubjects` when the carrier *answered* (including an answer of "no
assignments"), and ``None`` when it did not (timeout, 5xx, exhausted retries, or
a subject list longer than the page walk may read). The transform writes a row
only for an answer, so a network wobble leaves the bill un-enriched for the next
run instead of pinning an empty or truncated answer to it. Credential refusal
(401/403) aborts the run on the first answer, without retry. The subject table
retains carrier and time, not the response bytes.
