"""Cloudflare R2 Data Catalog (Apache Iceberg) connector.

The internal, write-side table format for the ETL. The catalog is **R2 Data
Catalog** — a managed Iceberg REST catalog built into the same R2 bucket the
project already publishes Parquet to, so no separate metastore (Glue/Nessie/
Postgres) has to be stood up.

DuckDB's ``iceberg`` and ``httpfs`` extensions provide catalog access. Version
1.5.3 or later supports the nullable-column addition used by PDF diagnostics.
The current upsert implementation uses DELETE + INSERT, keeping the row with
the most recent ``modify_date`` for each primary key.

This module is the "Iceberg load" stage only, mirroring the thin-wrapper style
of :mod:`spicy_regs.sources.r2`:

* :func:`merge_and_export` — ensure the table exists, MERGE the per-agency
  staging Parquet in, then export a public ``{name}.parquet`` snapshot so the
  no-credentials CLI / MCP read path keeps working (the "dual model").
* :func:`merge_comments` — the comments variant. Comments are tens of millions
  of rows, so there is no monolithic ``comments.parquet`` snapshot to keep
  fresh; the catalog table *is* the read surface (the MCP server queries it
  directly when the catalog is configured). Instead of exporting the whole
  table, this MERGEs the staged rows and rebuilds the tiny
  ``comments_index.parquet`` (per-partition row counts) that the feed summary
  and agency rollups read for comment counts.

Credentials are read from the environment, alongside the existing ``R2_*`` vars:

* ``R2_CATALOG_URI``        — the Iceberg REST catalog endpoint (catalog-uri)
* ``R2_CATALOG_WAREHOUSE``  — the warehouse name
* ``R2_CATALOG_TOKEN``      — an R2 API token with R2 + data-catalog permissions
* ``R2_CATALOG_NAMESPACE``  — Iceberg namespace/schema (optional, default ``default``)

    the staging rows to one per key (latest ``modify_date`` wins), keep only the

    CAVEAT — the ``DELETE`` does not reliably remove prior rows on the R2 Data
    Catalog (the same limitation that made the one-time seed duplicate rows and

    *re-merged* — an existing comment whose ``modify_date`` advanced, or a key the

    growing physical duplicate ``comment_id`` rows over time. Brand-new keys are

    enrichment). ``updates`` is a polars DataFrame with columns
    ``comment_id, _new_text, _new_status``. PDF enrichment also supplies
    ``_new_pdf_results``; derived-data updates preserve prior PDF attempts.
    Every row whose ``comment_id`` matches
    the agency's rows gets ``text_content`` / ``text_extraction_status`` refreshed

    """Collapse the catalog table to one row per ``dedup_key`` (latest modify_date).

    Builds a fresh deduped sibling table one agency at a time, then replaces the
    live table with it. Three constraints drive the shape:

    * Never ``DELETE``. The historical duplication came from loads whose ``DELETE``
      didn't remove prior rows on the R2 Data Catalog, so a delete-based cleanup
      could double the problem.
    * Never touch tens of millions of rows in one statement. A global
      ``ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY key)`` OOMs the runner on the read side,
      and a single ``CREATE OR REPLACE ... AS SELECT`` of the whole table OOMs it
      on the Iceberg *write* side. The build works per agency, and — because even
      one large agency's dedup window buffers whole rows (comment text included)
      and overflows the runner's memory limit despite on-disk spill — each agency
      is further split into hash buckets of the dedup key sized to
      ``DEDUP_ROWS_PER_BATCH`` rows. A key hashes to exactly one bucket and
      duplicates only ever share a key, so per-bucket dedup equals per-agency
      equals global dedup here; small agencies stay a single write.
    * Never ``ALTER TABLE RENAME``. DuckDB's Iceberg REST integration does not
      implement it (``NotImplementedException: Alter Schema Entry``), so the swap
      replaces the live table by ``DROP`` + ``CREATE`` + per-agency ``INSERT``
      from the sibling — all operations this catalog supports. The sibling is the
      durable copy: it is dropped only after the rebuilt table's row count is
      verified, so an interruption mid-swap loses nothing. A re-run detects the
      live table missing (but the sibling present) and resumes from the sibling
      instead of rebuilding it from a table that no longer exists.

    Returns ``(rows_before, rows_after)``; ``rows_after`` equals the number of
