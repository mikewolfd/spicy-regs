"""Cloudflare R2 Data Catalog (Apache Iceberg) connector.

The internal, write-side table format for the ETL. The catalog is **R2 Data
Catalog** — a managed Iceberg REST catalog built into the same R2 bucket the
project already publishes Parquet to, so no separate metastore (Glue/Nessie/
Postgres) has to be stood up.

DuckDB's ``iceberg`` and ``httpfs`` extensions provide catalog access. Version
1.5.3 or later supports the atomic MERGE used for paired writes.
The current upsert implementation uses a checked atomic MERGE, keeping the row with
the most recent ``modify_date`` for each primary key.

This module is the "Iceberg load" stage only, mirroring the thin-wrapper style
of :mod:`spicy_regs.sources.r2`:

* :func:`merge_and_export` — ensure the table exists, MERGE the per-agency
  staging Parquet in, then export a public ``{name}.parquet`` snapshot so the
  no-credentials CLI / MCP read path keeps working (the "dual model").
* :func:`merge_comments` upserts staged comments without rebuilding public files.
  :func:`export_public_comments` builds the compatible mirror and index together
  at the end of a successful ingestion sweep.

Credentials are read from the environment, alongside the existing ``R2_*`` vars:

* ``R2_CATALOG_URI``        — the Iceberg REST catalog endpoint (catalog-uri)
* ``R2_CATALOG_WAREHOUSE``  — the warehouse name
* ``R2_CATALOG_TOKEN``      — an R2 API token with R2 + data-catalog permissions
* ``R2_CATALOG_NAMESPACE``  — Iceberg namespace/schema (optional, default ``default``)

    loading it into Python, with columns ``comment_id, _new_text, _new_status``

    dropped column writes — ``text_content`` landed but ``text_extraction_status``
    came back NULL, so incremental re-runs kept re-selecting already-filled rows.
    Snapshotting into a self-contained temp table removes the live-table reference
    from the write path and fixes it (see PR #117). Plain DuckDB does not reproduce
    the catalog behavior, so this invariant is verified by a scoped catalog run,
