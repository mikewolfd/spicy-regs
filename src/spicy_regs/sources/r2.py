"""Cloudflare R2 storage connector.

The project's single home for R2 — both bookends of an incremental run: pulling
existing datasets down so a run can append to them (:func:`download_from_r2`),
and publishing finished Parquet, partitions, and the manifest back to the bucket
(:func:`upload_file` / :func:`upload_dataset` / :func:`upload_comment_partitions`).
This lets a pipeline treat "load" as one composable stage instead of reaching
into storage internals.

Downloads use the public ``R2_PUBLIC_URL`` over HTTPS; uploads use the S3 API
with ``R2_*`` credentials. Uploads are guarded against catastrophic shrink (see
:func:`_assert_upload_safe`) — the safeguard added after the March 2026 incident
where a transient download error produced an empty local file that overwrote the
3.3 GB historical ``comments.parquet`` on R2.
