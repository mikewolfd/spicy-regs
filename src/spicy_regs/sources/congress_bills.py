"""Reader connector for the Congress.gov public REST API (v3).

Brings congressional bill ingestion *in-repo* as an external source complementary
to the regulations.gov ``dockets``/``documents`` view — the legislative record
that sits upstream of the rulemakings this dataset tracks.

The reader is a *pure source*: it yields raw bill payloads (dicts) exactly as the
list endpoint returns them. Shaping them into the published 11-column schema is
the job of
:func:`~spicy_regs.transforms.build_congress_bills.build_congress_bills`.

The ``/bill`` list endpoint is paginated by ``offset``/``limit`` (``limit`` caps
at 250). An incremental run bounds its window *server-side* with ``fromDateTime``
/ ``toDateTime`` and pages until the window is exhausted, newest ``updateDate``
first. The upper bound is what lets a large catch-up be split into chunks that
each publish, so progress survives a failure partway through.

**Do not bound the window client-side by stopping at the first out-of-window
row.** That is what this reader used to do, and it froze the published table for
510 days: the ``sort`` parameter was being sent as ``updateDate%2Bdesc``, which
the API ignores while still answering ``200``, so rows arrived in arbitrary
order. The second row of the first page was older than the watermark, the walk
stopped there, and every run "succeeded" having yielded exactly one bill. The
window is now the server's job; ordering is only a paging-stability concern.

**API key.** Congress.gov requires an api.data.gov key sent as the ``api_key``
query param. The same key works across regulations.gov, Congress.gov, and
GovInfo, so we resolve it from a fallback chain of the env vars this repo already
uses (:func:`_resolve_api_key`). If no key is set the reader logs a clear warning
and yields nothing — a keyless CI run is a no-op, not a crash.
