"""Reader connector for the OpenFEC ``/committees`` endpoint (v1).

Brings Federal Election Commission committee/PAC ingestion *in-repo* as an
external **reference dimension** complementary to the regulations.gov corpus:
the political committees (PACs, party committees, campaign committees) whose
filings, endorsements, and money flows sit alongside the organizations that
comment on rulemakings. Downstream this feeds the dashboard's ally/opposition
(stance) map — a name to resolve commenters and co-filers against.

The reader is a *pure source*: it yields raw committee payloads (dicts) exactly
as the ``/committees`` list endpoint returns them. Shaping them into the pinned
16-column schema is the job of
:func:`~spicy_regs.transforms.build_fec_committees.build_fec_committees`.

**Scope.** Committees are a *reference dimension* (~89K rows), not itemized
contributions. Itemized ``/schedules/schedule_a`` receipts run into the hundreds
of millions of rows and are deliberately out of scope for this pass; a future
bounded-by-organization contributions pass could follow, keyed on the
``committee_id`` this table establishes.

**Pagination.** We walk with a stable sort key (``sort=committee_id``) and prefer
OpenFEC's documented **keyset (seek)** pagination: when the response envelope
carries a non-null ``pagination.last_indexes`` cursor we pass those keys straight
back as query params on the next request instead of incrementing ``page``. Not
every OpenFEC endpoint offers seek pagination — ``/committees`` in particular
returns ``last_indexes: null`` and is walked by incrementing ``page`` (the sort
key keeps that walk stable and duplicate-free). Either way the walk terminates
only when a page comes back **empty** (guarded by ``_MAX_PAGES``); it never stops
early on a short page. A short page mid-walk was the old bug: OpenFEC's deep
offset pages occasionally return fewer than ``per_page`` rows even when more
exist, and the previous ``len(results) < per_page`` early-break truncated the
backfill at ~26K of ~89K committees.

**API key.** OpenFEC is fronted by api.data.gov, so the same api.data.gov key
this repo already uses for regulations.gov / Congress.gov / GovInfo works here,
sent as the ``api_key`` query param. We resolve it from a fallback chain of the
env vars this repo already provides (:func:`_resolve_api_key`). If no key is set
the reader logs a clear warning and yields nothing — a keyless CI run is a no-op,
not a crash.
