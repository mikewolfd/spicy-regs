"""Today's Senate committee file through the shared walled-fetch ladder, when a run opts in (ss-ehci).

www.senate.gov answers ``cvc_member_data.xml`` with HTTP 403 to this Mac and to GitHub's runners (measured
2026-11-01 and 2026-11-08). Owner decision 2026-11-08: read it through the paid ladder, Zyte first and Firecrawl as
the fallback.

:class:`LadderCommitteeRosterAcquirer` is the chamber-file acquirer with one change: today's Senate file goes
through ``SourceAcquirer.capture_walled``, spicy-docs' ladder (one direct attempt on this acquirer's own client,
then one Zyte ``httpResponseBody`` call, then one Firecrawl ``rawBase64`` call, then the opt-in Zyte session rung:
Zyte's browser opens ``https://www.senate.gov/`` and fetches the file same-origin, returning the captured response
bytes; never a rendered page). The session rung is the one that served the file when measured on 2026-11-09; the
others answered 403, 520 and 500. It is the fourth request, so the budget must allow four (``ROSTER_BUDGET`` does)
or the ladder refuses before any paid call. Every rung is
charged and paced on the same ``CommitteeRosterBudget`` as a direct capture, and each answer is held to the budget's
byte bound, the exact locator (``check_final_url``), the file's media types (``text/xml``/``application/xml``) and
the reader's own validation. A 2xx error or interstitial page (spicy-docs' one classifier, plus
:func:`is_senate_xml`) escalates to the next rung; the file under a wrong media type or locator stops the ladder. The timeout is the budget's, per rung: the worst case is four timeouts in a row
(4 x 120 s with the rollup's ``ROSTER_BUDGET``). When every rung fails, ``CommitteeRosterRefusedError`` carries the
ladder's ``rung_outcomes`` and the run stops, as a direct refusal always has. The House file, and any archived
capture (``archived_at``), are read exactly as before.

The serving rung is retained: the capture is kept with stage ``senate-cvc:<rung>`` and journaled as
``senate-roster-rung`` with the provider's request id.
