"""Read values a table keeps in its ETL receipts, by table, row key and field: the logic of ``read_receipt_fields``.

A receipt holds the fields its table's policy declares and, for most families, a mapping of the row's fields as
the family's mapper received them. What that gives differs by table and can shrink with a policy, so the fields on
offer are worked out per call from the installed policy and the bundled ``receipt_fields.json``
(``receipt_field_declarations``); nothing here assumes a receipt holds a row's whole original record. The receipt
codec and the row identity digest are ``etl_receipts``' own, imported when a lookup runs: that module needs
pyarrow, which describing a table does not.
