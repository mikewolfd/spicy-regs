"""Upsert a fresh native subject/receipt pair over a prior one without restoring rows.

A nightly that fetches only a window (lobbying's posted-date window, a day's regulatory attribute parts) has the prior
generation's subject and receipt files already admitted. :func:`native_merge` is that merge at the native level, in
DuckDB and Arrow:

* subjects are the prior ones whose identity the fresh pair does not carry, plus the fresh ones, in ``order_by`` order
  (what ``table_merge.merge_local_prior`` yields on the same columns, DuckDB's null ordering included);
* accepted receipts are those of the kept prior subjects, verbatim, plus ``carry_receipt_history`` of the fresh receipts
  against the prior receipts they replace: a refetched row that did not change keeps its prior receipt, a changed one
  references only its direct predecessor, a new one is fresh. Accepted receipts follow their subjects' order, as the
  restore readers expect; the fresh pair's other receipts (refusals, observations) come last, in their own order.
  Unresolved prior refusals survive unchanged until a fresh accepted receipt proves the same input converted.
  Other prior non-accepted receipts survive only if repeated: a family that keeps per-file observations for the kept
  rows (regulatory ``input_metadata``) must repeat them in its fresh pair.

Only narrow keys are ever sorted or joined (ordinals and record ids, about 100 bytes a row); wide subject and receipt
rows are gathered by ordinal, one output batch at a time, each source row group read once per batch. Kept prior rows
already sit in ``order_by`` order, so the gather is nearly sequential. Receipt work is O(fresh rows); what stays
O(all rows) is the narrow sort and one pass over each file. The caller admits the result once, as it admits any
generation; nothing here validates it beyond refusing a subject with no receipt. The prior pair must already be
admitted, and its receipts scoped to the dataset.
