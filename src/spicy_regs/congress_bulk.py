"""Flat Congress datasets a column at a time: the bundle the row writer writes and the table it restores.

``congress_receipts.write_congress_dataset`` maps, splits, serializes and validates one row at a time, and
``restore_processing_input`` decodes one receipt at a time, over several passes. For ``member_votes`` and
``member_vote_terms`` (10.56M rows each on 2026-10-05) that was about 3.3 hours a table against a 60-minute job.
:func:`write_bundle` and :func:`restore_input` give the same receipts and the same restored rows from ordered source
batches. The original flat-table benchmark on the first million rows of both tables checked every receipt at the
same position and the restored table against its source: 5.5 to 8.4 microseconds a row against 577 to 692.

The row code stays the reference and keeps the rows SQL cannot own: a row whose text ``etl_bulk`` spells differently
from Python, and a row the mapper would refuse. Those come back from the ``row_receipt`` and ``row_fields`` callables
the caller passes, which are the row code's own functions, so each rule lives in one place. Such a row's own text
rides along in the one scan. Nothing here runs a second statement on a connection that is still streaming: that ends
the stream without an error, and a bundle cut short that way is consistent with itself (2026-10-05: 199,999 of
1,000,000 rows restored, nothing raised). So each scan also checks that its rows arrive in file order and that it read
as many as the file's own footer counts.

A dataset is taken only when :func:`eligible` says every rule the mapper applies to it is one of the three this
module states in SQL: a column passed through as text, a digit string read as an integer, and a row given no subject.
