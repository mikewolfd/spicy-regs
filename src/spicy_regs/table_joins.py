"""The published tables' cross-table joins: declared once, with the measured baseline each is held to.

A join names a child table and columns and the parent table and columns they
reference. It resolves when a distinct non-null child key occurs in the parent.
Each carries a measured rate (``BASELINE_RECEIPTS``, with later dates in each
reason or measurement); its floor is that rate truncated to four decimals, and
``scripts/check_table_joins.py`` fails a join that falls below it. Joins that
are low by design, or by a table's current selection, are declared with that
rate and the reason, so the check still covers them. ``spicy-regs-dict
generate`` bundles them as ``table_joins.json`` beside ``table_metadata.json``
and ``check`` refuses a stale copy. ``references`` is the measurement-free
shape; SpicyDocs 0.36.0 contracts state the joins onto a parent's identity as
``TableContract.references``, and ``tests/test_table_joins.py`` holds each of
those to a join declared here. Standard library only: the MCP image imports it.
