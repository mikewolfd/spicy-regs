    The source file remains in place. Its digest and row ordinal identify the

    witnesses. The first witness never asserts that a shaped file is an original
    publisher response.

    ``on_fresh_failure`` reports a fresh refused/error attempt before carry can
    reuse its older receipt. The caller can retain the completed private bundle
    while refusing its publication.

    A bulk-eligible dataset is written in one scan. Selected prior evidence is
    carried by ``receipt_history.carry_receipt_history``: an unchanged row keeps its prior receipt
    verbatim (original generation and witnesses), a changed accepted row points to its direct
    predecessor, so receipt size does not grow with the number of nights. ``bulk=False`` delegates
    to the public row writer, which carries the same way, so it is the independent reference.

    ``validate=False`` leaves admission to the caller: the prior pair was admitted when it was selected and
    the new pair is admitted once with its generation. Standalone callers keep the default.
    ``split_receipts`` opts member_votes into ordered Congress members. It is
    disabled by default until deployed readers support split receipts. Failed
    split attempts retain their private stage; no combined output is emitted.
    ``prior_scoped`` reuses the owner's pinned dataset selection without filtering
    and writing another prior receipt file; admission behavior is unchanged.
