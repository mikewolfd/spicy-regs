"""Publish one locally built generation of a family that no hosted workflow builds.

``--dry-run`` runs the real publication guards against a private disk store seeded with the public
index: no credentials are read and nothing leaves this machine. Without it the command compares with
the stored index, writes to the verified R2 target, then reads the family back as an anonymous reader
and records what was served. The per-family steps are in docs/local-family-refresh.md.

``unpublish-families`` (:func:`unpublish_main`) is the reverse hand write: it takes whole families out of the
index through the same conditional pointer write, a dry run unless told the index ETag to replace.
