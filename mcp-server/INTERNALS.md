This is the rationale behind the MCP server implementation
(`src/spicy_regs/mcp_server.py`). The source is comment-free by project policy
(documentation lives in markdown), so this document explains what the code does
and why.

> **History:** there used to be a second, hand-mirrored copy at
> `mcp-server/api/index.py` — a dependency-light parallel of the canonical server
> for a Vercel deployment, kept in sync by `test_vercel_copy_in_sync`. The server
> now runs on Cloud Run (see `deploy/cloudrun/`) from the **canonical** module
> directly (importing it pulls only duckdb + mcp, no ETL deps), so the copy and
> its sync test were removed. Everything below is the single canonical server.

## What must never be deleted

**The three `@mcp.tool()` docstrings are not documentation — do not delete them.**
FastMCP reflects over `fn.__doc__` to build the tool descriptions sent to every
client during `list_tools`. `describe_table`'s docstring is how a client learns
which tables are valid; `query_sql`'s is how it learns the available views.
Strip them and the server still runs, but every client goes blind. Verify with
`asyncio.run(build_server().list_tools())`.

**Inline `# type: ignore` / `# noqa` are directives, not comments.** `ty` and
`ruff` gate merges and both read them. `_build_connection` needs `# type: ignore[index]`
on `catalog["namespace"]`.

## Connection setup (`_build_connection`, `_get_connection`, `_apply_security_settings`)

- `SET home_directory` **must precede** `INSTALL`/`LOAD`. DuckDB writes
  extensions under `<home_directory>/.duckdb`, and the default home is read-only
  or undefined on serverless hosts — hence `_resolve_home_directory` defaulting
  to the temp dir (`SPICY_REGS_HOME_DIR` overrides).
- **Do NOT disable `LocalFileSystem`.** It looks like an obvious guard against
  user SQL reading local files, but httpfs reads the system CA bundle off the
  local filesystem on every TLS handshake. Disabling it breaks the only thing
  this server does: the moment a view binds you get `File system LocalFileSystem
  has been disabled by configuration`.
- `SET temp_directory=''` is the sandbox that replaces it. `temp_directory`
  defaults to a local `.tmp` that is read-only on serverless hosts, so a spilling
  query (big GROUP BY/ORDER BY) fails there regardless. Empty disables spilling —
  queries run in memory or fail with a clear OOM.
- `_apply_security_settings` is deliberately separate from `_build_connection` so the
  sandbox is testable without network. Run it after httpfs loads and before any
  user SQL; `SET lock_configuration=true` is last because it freezes everything.

## The read-only statement guard

`query_sql` hands arbitrary SQL to `cursor.execute()`, so without a gate the
public endpoint accepts writes. `COPY ... TO`, `ATTACH`, and `EXPORT DATABASE`
all reach the container filesystem, and on Cloud Run that filesystem is
in-memory — a large enough `COPY` evicts the instance. The service is
`--allow-unauthenticated`, so that is an anonymous availability lever.

The obvious fix, `SET disabled_filesystems='LocalFileSystem'`, is the one thing
that must not be done (see above — httpfs needs the CA bundle). Hence
`_first_write_statement`, which classifies with DuckDB's own parser via
`extract_statements` and admits only `SELECT` and `EXPLAIN`.

**Do not swap the parser for a prefix regex.** The parser is what makes leading
comments (`/* c */ COPY ...`), `COPY` inside a string literal, and stacked
statements (`SELECT 1; DROP TABLE t`) classify correctly. The stacked case
matters most: `execute` runs every statement in the string but returns only the
last result, so a trailing write would otherwise land with nothing in the
response to show for it.

**The two-entry allowlist is not as narrow as it looks.** DuckDB folds
`DESCRIBE`, `SHOW`, `SUMMARIZE`, `VALUES`, `TABLE`, and the FROM-first
shorthand (`FROM comments LIMIT 1`) into `StatementType.SELECT`, so all of them
still run. `tests/test_mcp_server.py::test_read_forms_pass_the_guard` pins that
folding; if a DuckDB upgrade splits any of them into its own statement type,
that test fails rather than clients silently losing a query form.

Matching is on `StatementType.name`, not the enum member, because duckdb's type
stubs do not declare the members and `ty` gates merges — comparing names keeps
the check honest without a blanket type-ignore.

This guard does **not** stop local file *reads*: `read_text`, `read_csv`, and
`read_blob` are `SELECT`s. Nothing sensitive sits on the container filesystem
today (the R2 catalog token arrives as an env var, `getenv` does not exist in
DuckDB, and `duckdb_secrets()` redacts the token), so the exposure is latent
rather than live. It stops being latent the moment a secret is mounted as a
file — if the catalog token ever moves to a Cloud Run secret *volume*, this
needs a companion path check.

## The statement timeout

**DuckDB has no `statement_timeout` parameter.** `SET statement_timeout=...`
raises `Catalog Error: unrecognized configuration parameter` — this was a shipped
runtime crash once, and `tests/test_mcp_server.py` guards the regression. The cap
is a watchdog (`_statement_timeout`) that calls `cursor.interrupt()` and converts
DuckDB's `InterruptException` into a `TimeoutError` so the cause is unambiguous.

`SPICY_REGS_STATEMENT_TIMEOUT` defaults to `790s` in code; the Cloud Run
deployment sets it to `600s` via env (matching the service `--timeout`), so a
runaway query returns a clean `TimeoutError` rather than a platform-killed 5xx.
Keep the app timeout at or below the platform request timeout. In practice the
binding limit is usually the *MCP client*, which typically gives up at 60–120s.
The stdio entrypoint has no platform limit at all.

## Iceberg catalog attach (`_attach_catalog`)

Best-effort by design: a bad token, network failure, or missing table falls back
to the monolithic `comments.parquet` rather than taking the server down. Must run
**before** `_apply_security_settings` locks the configuration.

`INSTALL avro` / `LOAD avro` explicitly, before iceberg, is load-bearing. DuckDB
1.5's iceberg extension reads Avro manifests via a separate `avro` extension and
tries to auto-install it lazily during `LOAD` — but that nested install doesn't
inherit the session's `home_directory` in serverless sandboxes and dies with
`Can't find the home directory at ''`, failing the whole attach so comments
silently fall back to the frozen monolith. Installing it explicitly runs on the
same top-level path that already installs httpfs/iceberg fine. Wrapped in its own
try/except because on DuckDB <1.5 avro isn't separate and `INSTALL avro` errors.

## Why the comments view has a QUALIFY

The catalog table can physically hold duplicate `comment_id` rows. DuckDB's
Iceberg engine has no `MERGE INTO`, so the ETL upsert (`iceberg._merge`) removes
superseded rows with a plain `DELETE` — and `DELETE` does not reliably remove
prior rows on the R2 Data Catalog (the same limitation `dedupe_table` works
around by never deleting). Any re-merged `comment_id` can leave its old row
beside the new one. The `QUALIFY ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY comment_id ORDER
BY modify_date DESC NULLS LAST) = 1` makes the read surface single-valued
regardless, so counts aren't inflated. Physical compaction happens out-of-band via
`scripts/dedupe_comments_catalog.py`. A filter on `agency_code`/`docket_id` pushes
down ahead of the window, so point lookups only dedup rows they touch.

A table in `TABLES` whose parquet isn't published yet (a new source whose first
upload hasn't run) is skipped with a warning rather than breaking every query —
same degradation strategy as the catalog fallback.

## Ledger qualification (`_qualification`)

`list_sources` and `describe_table` report the output ledger's audit for each
table beside its live pin. The ledger is Markdown under `docs/research/`, which
the image does not ship, so `spicy-regs-dict generate` bundles
`table_qualification.json` (built by `spicy_regs.output_ledger`) and `check`
refuses a stale copy. `_ledger` reads it once per process.

- **Only for the ledger's publisher.** The record names the destination the
  ledger audits. A server reading any other base URL, or a local directory,
  reports `unknown_for_publisher` and no pins: the same pin on another bucket
  proves nothing about this ledger.
- **Pins compare by kind.** A family pin compares with the snapshot's
  `artifactDigest`; a base object's `verified at table digest` pin compares with
  its managed table's `sha256`. A table the index does not manage has no live
  pin, and the reply says it cannot compare rather than guessing from a bare URL.
- **Separate fields, never one verified flag.** `ledger_disposition` is the
  row's word (`qualified`, `PARTIAL`, `FAILED`, `verified`) for `ledger_pin`
  only. `generation` says whether the live pin is one the ledger audited, so a
  `FAILED` generation that is still live reads as "current generation audited"
  plus `FAILED`. With no match, the ledger's latest audit is shown.
- **Closed vocabulary.** "Published at" is a publication statement, not an
  audit. A new or misspelled audit word fails the build instead of being read as
  either an audit or its absence; add it to `output_ledger` deliberately.

## DNS rebinding protection is off in `build_app`

Deliberate. The deployment is reached via `mcp.spicy-regs.dev` and per-deploy Cloud Run
`*.run.app` hosts; FastMCP's default localhost-only allowlist would reject all
of them with **421**. The server is public, stateless, and read-only, so
rebinding protection buys nothing.

## Other invariants

- `ICONS` uses a base64 `data:` URI, not an `https://` URL, so it works on both
  the stdio and HTTP transports. Generated by `scripts/gen_icon.py`.
- `_resolve_catalog_config` and `_resolve_r2_base_url` reject quotes,
  backslashes, and control characters outright rather than escaping them, because
  the values are inlined into `CREATE SECRET`/`ATTACH`/`read_parquet`, which take
  no bind parameters.
- `R2_CATALOG_NAMESPACE` uses `or DEFAULT` rather than `get`'s default argument so
  an env var set to the empty string falls back to `default` instead of `""`.
