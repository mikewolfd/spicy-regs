## Getting started

Prerequisites: **Python 3.10+** and [**uv**](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

1. Fork the repo on GitHub, then clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/spicy-regs.git
   cd spicy-regs
   ```
2. Create a feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b my-change
   ```
3. Install dependencies (creates a `.venv` in the project directory):
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```
4. Run the tests to confirm your environment works:
   ```bash
   uv run pytest
   ```
   The default suite is hermetic: tests for optional-extra adapters run
   against injected stand-ins. The Docling fallback parser — which today
   serves DOCX, PPTX, and XLSX only, through the model-free
   `SimplePipeline`, and refuses PDF and image inputs by name — also has
   real-provider tests, which skip themselves unless the pinned extra is
   installed:
   ```bash
   uv run --frozen --extra docling pytest tests/test_docpipeline_adapter_docling_real.py
   ```
   Installing that extra raises `pydantic-settings` to the version
   `docling-core` requires (2.14.2); `mcp` shares that dependency in the
   default environment, so the lock change is not extra-only. Re-sync the
   default environment afterwards with
   `uv sync --frozen --extra embed --extra evaluation`.
5. Run the linter:
   ```bash
   uv run ruff check .
   uv run ruff format .   # auto-format
   ```
6. (Recommended) Install the pre-commit hooks so ruff and ty run
   automatically on `git commit`:
   ```bash
   uv run pre-commit install
   ```
   The hooks run `ruff check --fix`, `ruff format`, and `ty check`. You
   can also run them manually:
   ```bash
   uv run pre-commit run --all-files
   ```

You don't need any credentials to run the tests or hack on most of the code.
A `.env` file (copy from `.env.example`) is only required to *upload* to live
Cloudflare R2 storage — reading from the public Mirrulations mirror and
downloading our published parquet files both work anonymously.

### Get the data on your machine

Two ways to get real data locally — pick whichever fits your task.

**A. Download the published parquet files (fast, ~minutes).** Pulls our
processed output from the public R2 bucket:

```bash
uv run spicy-regs download                       # dockets + documents + comments
uv run spicy-regs download --types comments      # just comments
uv run spicy-regs stats                          # sanity-check what you got
uv run spicy-regs sample comments -n 5           # peek at a few rows
```

Files default to `./spicy-regs-data/`; override with `-o some/dir`.

**B. Run the ETL pipeline yourself (slower, but it's the real thing).**
Reads JSON from the Mirrulations S3 mirror, flattens it, writes Parquet to
`./output/`. Keep the first run tiny so it finishes quickly:

```bash
# One agency, recent only, comments only — finishes in a few minutes.
uv run run-pipeline --agency EPA --only-comments --since-year 2025
```

Outputs land in `./output/` (e.g. `output/comments.parquet`) alongside an
incremental `manifest.json` — re-running picks up where the last run left
off. Drop `--only-comments` / `--agency` / `--since-year` to widen the scope;
add `--full-refresh` to ignore the manifest. `uv run run-pipeline --help`
lists every flag. Upload to R2 stays off by default (`--skip-upload`); only
the maintainers publish.

### Stuck?

- Open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/civictechdc/spicy-regs/issues/new/choose) — we don't bite.
- Ping us on [Slack](https://civictechdc.slack.com/archives/C09H576E6LU).

## Making changes

- Keep changes focused and scoped to one concern per PR.
- Follow existing code style and conventions (ruff handles most of this).
- Add or update tests for any behavior change.
- Run `uv run pytest` and `uv run ruff check .` before pushing.
- Never call `load_dotenv()` at module scope. Importing the package must not
  mutate `os.environ` — that leaks a developer's `.env` into unit tests and
  points them at production R2. Call it in the CLI entry point instead (the
  `@app.default` command, or `main()`). `tests/test_env_loading.py` enforces
  this.
- The default suite is hermetic. An autouse `isolate_env` fixture in
  `tests/conftest.py` also strips `R2_*`, `SPICY_REGS_*`, `CLOUDFLARE_*`,
  `AWS_*`, `AGENCIES`, and the API keys as defence in depth. If a test genuinely
  needs real credentials or the network, mark it `@pytest.mark.integration` — the
  fixture exempts those, and they're deselected by default.

## Glossary

Some terms you'll see throughout the codebase:

| Term            | What it means |
|-----------------|---------------|
| **Regulations.gov** | The U.S. federal government's public docket portal. Our upstream data source. |
| **Mirrulations** | A public mirror of regulations.gov data hosted on AWS S3 ([repo](https://github.com/MoravianUniversity/mirrulations)). We read from it instead of hitting the regulations.gov API directly. |
| **R2**          | Cloudflare R2 — S3-compatible object storage. We use it as our processed-data store. |
| **S3**          | Amazon S3 — where Mirrulations hosts the raw upstream data. |
| **Staging files** | Intermediate per-agency files written during a pipeline run, before final merge/partition. |
| **Manifest**    | A small file listing already-processed source keys, used to make ETL runs incremental. |
| **Bulk transforms** | Whole-dataset operations (dedup, partition, summarize) that need every row at once. Live in `transforms/merge.py` as plain functions. |
| **Agency**      | A federal agency (EPA, DOL, etc.). Pipelines fan out per-agency. |

The CLI entrypoints are defined in `pyproject.toml` under `[project.scripts]`:
- `spicy-regs` — main CLI
- `run-pipeline` / `etl` — pipeline runners
- `spicy-regs-mcp` — stdio MCP server
- `embed` — vector embedding (requires the `embed` extra)

## Architecture: the ETL building blocks

The ETL is built from a few small, composable abstractions. Data flows through
them in one direction:

```
Reader  ->  Transform  ->  Writer        (a record at a time)
   \____________ Pipeline ____________/   (wires them together + runs)
```

| Concept       | Base class                              | What it does                                  | Example |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------|
| `RecordType`  | `spicy_regs.schemas` (a value, not a subclass) | Describes one data shape: schema, primary key, extractor | `schemas/regulations.py` |
| `Reader`      | `spicy_regs.sources.base.Reader`        | A **source**: yields raw records              | `sources/mirrulations.py` |
| `Transform`   | `spicy_regs.transforms.base.Transform`  | Maps a record stream → record stream          | `transforms/extract.py` |
| `Writer`      | `spicy_regs.sources.base.Writer`        | A **sink**: persists records                  | `sources/parquet.py` |
| `Pipeline`    | `spicy_regs.pipelines.base.Pipeline`    | Composes the above and exposes `run()`        | `pipelines/regulations.py` |

Start with **`tests/test_example_pipeline.py`** — a runnable, minimal pipeline
with one of each base class wired together. Copy it.

Supporting pieces a pipeline can reuse:

- `pipelines/staging.py` — `stage_agencies(...)` fans agencies out in parallel,
  pumping each `Reader → Transform → Writer`.
- `manifest.py` — `Manifest` tracks already-processed keys for incremental runs.
- `sources/r2.py` — Cloudflare R2 download/upload helpers.

**Two kinds of "transform."** A `Transform` shapes records one at a time
(`apply(records) -> records`). Whole-dataset operations that need every row at
once — deduplicating, partitioning, summaries — are *bulk* transforms and live
in `transforms/merge.py`; they are functions, not `Transform` subclasses.

**Convention:** `Reader`, `Writer`, and `Transform` are classes you subclass.
Plain helper modules (e.g. `sources/r2.py`) are storage/connection utilities,
not connectors — don't subclass them.

### Recipes

- **Add a record shape:** construct a new `RecordType` in `schemas/` (set
  `path_pattern` only if your source addresses files by path).
- **Add a source:** subclass `Reader`, implement `iter_records()` to yield raw
  payloads (keep extraction out of the reader). See `sources/mirrulations.py`.
- **Add a transform:** subclass `Transform`, implement `apply()`. See
  `transforms/extract.py`.
- **Add a sink:** subclass `Writer`, implement `write()`. See `sources/parquet.py`.
- **Add a pipeline:** subclass `Pipeline`, set a `name`, compose your pieces in
  `run()`. Register it for the CLI in `pipelines/regulations.py`'s `app` if it
  should be runnable via `run-pipeline`.
