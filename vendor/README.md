# Source reader wheels

`uv sync --frozen` installs these through the default `source-readers` group.
The optional `source-readers` extra enables the same readers for package installs;
its wheels must be supplied explicitly until they are published in a registry.
Base CLI and MCP installs do not require them.

- `spicy_docs-0.21.0`: built with `uv build` from SpicyDocs commit
  `ff92406` (tag v0.21.0), 2026-09-19. SHA-256:
  `ca3f26c5361f26bd3d38d7789277bff2a72ebfd224a65e65e0f24ec4ed241705`
  (1,009,120 bytes). Carries the table-contract layer: `spicy_docs.schemas`'
  twenty-two `TableContract`s with their columns, identity, version column,
  grain and per-column prose, the `shape_*` function per table, and
  `interpretation/bill_family.py`'s `build_bill_family`, which produces twelve
  of them in one pass. The pin adds the `bill-diff` extra for the three diff
  tables. Replaces 0.20.0 (`b96e083`, SHA-256 `594a2f01…`).
- `rulespec_artifacts-1.0.13`: required by spicy-docs 0.21.0, which pins it
  exactly; 1.0.12 no longer resolves. Nothing here imports it — it is a
  transitive pin vendored under the same discipline. Byte-identical to the
  wheel `rulespec` itself built (`dist/artifacts/`) and to the one spicy-docs
  vendors. SHA-256:
  `72d15ff9453bb819ab5945141dea92cae6c3ff5f76e1d26bb04849cf690bf377`.
- `deltatrack-0.1.0`: built with `uv build --wheel` from `civictechdc/DeltaTrack`
  commit `c636448ba08d55bba7cb8c884aad0f5ac1ccf2f6`, 2026-09-19.
  SHA-256: `7f060e30af9702f4e45c305fa93c53d1e3e59bd70858d3c6717f6fc9cf825197`.
  DeltaTrack is a git dependency (SpicyDocs' `bill-diff` extra pins
  `git+https://github.com/civictechdc/DeltaTrack?rev=c636448…`), not a
  registry package, so it is vendored the same way as the other source-reader
  wheels here rather than resolved transitively. It exists for the bill-diff
  tables (`section_diffs`, `section_diff_items`, `financial_changes`) that
  `docs/research/table-contracts-2026-09-19.md` §5.4 describes, and the 0.21.0
  pin now reaches them. `[tool.uv.sources]` alone was
  not enough: a uv source binds a dependency the project declares, and
  DeltaTrack arrives only through spicy-docs' `bill-diff` extra, so uv looked
  for it in the registry and failed the resolve. `deltatrack==0.1.0` is
  therefore also declared directly in both `source-readers` lists — the same
  shape `rulespec-artifacts` already had for the same reason.
- `uv.lock` records every wheel SHA-256 above. Replace the wheel and refresh the
  lock together, then run receiver tests against the installed wheel.

PDF enrichment uses the narrow `pdf-pypdf` provider extra through `source-readers`.
SpicyRegs additionally pins pypdf `6.14.2` and checks that version before parsing;
package installs and checkouts therefore use the same qualified PDF behavior.

CourtListener listing, pins and raw rows use the shared provider directly. Run
`uv run pytest tests/test_courtlistener_bulk.py tests/test_courtlistener_shared.py tests/test_court_scope.py tests/test_cluster_court_scope_backfill.py`
for this receiving change. Before replacing the provider wheel, also run the
BILLSTATUS, Unified Agenda and PDF reader tests (`test_bill_subjects.py`,
`test_unified_agenda*.py`, `test_pdf_text*.py`).
