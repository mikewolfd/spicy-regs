# Source reader wheels

`uv sync --frozen` installs these through the default `source-readers` group.
The optional `source-readers` extra enables the same readers for package installs;
its wheels must be supplied explicitly until they are published in a registry.
Base CLI and MCP installs do not require them.

- `spicy_docs-0.24.0`: built from SpicyDocs `713c821` (tag `v0.24.0`),
  2026-09-20. Verified before and after copying: **1,319,390 bytes**, SHA-256
  `0a03ce34916cfedf4162356dd49e8dc4d95cb50e9dd280f4256c087d379f680a`.
  Both pins and the uv source move together; `uv.lock` records the same digest.
  Replaces 0.23.0 (`73b10e5`, 1,259,241 bytes, `36d619a6…4f66`).

  Independent dumps from both wheels establish **39 contracts, 813 columns**
  (previously 37, 766). New: `hearing_bill_links` (12 columns, key
  `package_id, bill_id, link_source`) and `cbo_cost_estimates` (16, key
  `bill_id, publication_id`). Appended: `house_communications` +5 provenance
  columns, `committee_reports` +13 CBO letter columns, `congress_bills` +1
  estimate outcome. Existing prefixes, keys and version columns are unchanged.
  Prose also changes on `budget_volumes`, `hearing_transcripts` and
  `house_activity_reports`; every other contract is identical.

  Seven modules added and twelve changed; the complete wheel and registry
  comparison is retained in
  `receipts/rollups-0-24-0-adoption-2026-09-20/contracts-comparison.json`.
  The release supplies the Mirrulations refusal/retry reader, activity-report
  selection, PDF-first print preference, thirteen measured BUDGET parts,
  hearing cover/agenda rules and repository reader, CBO index and letter rule,
  and Record communication reconstruction. Hosting adopts these public
  functions; the Record acquisition backfill is a separate rollup.
  `shape_hearing_transcript` no longer accepts `bill_id`: hearing relationships
  are one-to-many and live in `hearing_bill_links`.

- `rulespec_artifacts-1.0.13`: required by spicy-docs 0.24.0, which pins it
  exactly; 1.0.12 no longer resolves. Nothing here imports it — it is a
  transitive pin vendored under the same discipline. Byte-identical to the
  wheel `rulespec` itself built (`dist/artifacts/`) and to the one spicy-docs
  vendors. SHA-256:
  `72d15ff9453bb819ab5945141dea92cae6c3ff5f76e1d26bb04849cf690bf377`.
- `deltatrack-0.1.0`: built with `uv build --wheel` from `civictechdc/DeltaTrack`
  commit `c636448ba08d55bba7cb8c884aad0f5ac1ccf2f6`, 2026-09-19.
  SHA-256: `7f060e30af9702f4e45c305fa93c53d1e3e59bd70858d3c6717f6fc9cf825197`.
  DeltaTrack is a git dependency (SpicyDocs' `bill-diff` extra pins
  `git+https://github.com/civictechdc/DeltaTrack?rev=c636448…`), not a
  registry package, so it is vendored the same way as the other source-reader
  wheels here rather than resolved transitively. It exists for the bill-diff
  tables (`section_diffs`, `section_diff_items`, `financial_changes`) that
  `docs/research/table-contracts-2026-09-19.md` §5.4 describes, and the 0.21.x
  pin reaches them. `[tool.uv.sources]` alone was
  not enough: a uv source binds a dependency the project declares, and
  DeltaTrack arrives only through spicy-docs' `bill-diff` extra, so uv looked
  for it in the registry and failed the resolve. `deltatrack==0.1.0` is
  therefore also declared directly in both `source-readers` lists — the same
  shape `rulespec-artifacts` already had for the same reason.
- `uv.lock` records every wheel SHA-256 above. Replace the wheel and refresh the
  lock together, then run receiver tests against the installed wheel.

PDF enrichment (`transforms/pdf_text.py::extract_pdf_text`, the regulations.gov
attachment path) uses the narrow `pdf-pypdf` provider extra through
`source-readers`. SpicyRegs additionally pins pypdf `6.14.2` and checks that
version before parsing; package installs and checkouts therefore use the same
qualified PDF behavior.

The GovInfo *body* path is different: `extraction.body_text`'s PDF branch
(both `build_bill_family.py` and `build_committee_reports.py`) runs through
`body_text`'s default extractor, `DocumentExtractor(NativeText())`, whose
default reader opens PDFs with PyMuPDF — now installed via the `pdf` extra —
rather than through a pypdf adapter. This is not a licensing call; the user's
ruling is that results decide, not licensing (PyMuPDF is AGPL/commercial
dual-licensed; pypdfium2, which DeltaTrack itself uses, is BSD/Apache — the
same spicy-docs research doc measured it too and found it handles the two
genuinely GPO-numbered fixtures as well as PyMuPDF, but introduces false
hyphen rejoins on non-numbered layouts that spicy-docs's own extractor
declines; adopting it is a spicy-docs-side question, out of scope here). It is
a correctness one: `extraction/gpo_normalize.py`'s layout detector was derived
against PyMuPDF's line-grouped text, where a GPO gutter line number comes back
as its own physical line immediately after its content line. pypdf glues that
number onto the end of the content line instead (`Representa-1`), so the
detector's adjacency check never fires — measured on real GovInfo PDFs in
spicy-docs `docs/research/gpo-normalizer-vs-upstream-2026-09-19.md`: 0 of 6,
then 0 of 12, real gutter numbers correctly detected under pypdf, against 6 of
6 and 12 of 12 under PyMuPDF, on the same two documents. Under pypdf, three of
the normalizer's rules — layout detection, hyphen rejoin, and the
gutter-evidenced half of the bare-digit strip gate — are structurally
unreachable on every PDF-derived GovInfo body, not just occasionally
degraded. Routing this path through spicy-docs's default extractor instead of
`transforms/pdf_text.py::PypdfPageExtractor` (removed) is what restores it.
`pdf-pypdf` stays in `source-readers` only because `extract_pdf_text` still
needs it for the unrelated attachment path above.

CourtListener listing, pins and raw rows use the shared provider directly. Run
`uv run pytest tests/test_courtlistener_bulk.py tests/test_courtlistener_shared.py tests/test_court_scope.py tests/test_cluster_court_scope_backfill.py`
for this receiving change. Before replacing the provider wheel, also run the
BILLSTATUS, Unified Agenda and PDF reader tests (`test_bill_subjects.py`,
`test_unified_agenda*.py`, `test_pdf_text*.py`).
