"""Hermetic test for the roll-call transform's two linkage sources.

No network: both chambers' indexes and the vote acquirer are stubbed, and the
``bill_vote_references`` table the bill family publishes is seeded where the
transform's best-effort download looks for it.

The headline case is the measured sample — the 58 ``recordedVotes`` entries
spicy-docs read off 20 bills of the 119th Congress
(``tests/fixtures/congress_votes/README.md``) — which must resolve to 34
distinct roll calls with no two references disagreeing. That number is a
property of real publisher data, so a change in how this transform reads or
indexes the references moves it; a synthetic fixture could not fail the same
way.
