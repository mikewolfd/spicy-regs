"""The Federal Register table across the move away from per-row receipts (ss-vse3), on a cut of real data.

``fixtures/federal_register_switch`` (``manifest.json`` names every source):

- ``prior/``: 164 rows of the generation published 2026-10-30 (f0ce213e…, ``regulations-native-v1``) with their
  receipts, exactly as published: 36 of the 221 documents of 2026-10-29/30, 120 rows of one 2009 row group, and
  eight edge rows chosen by hand (below).
- ``pages/``: two cuts of that run's one retained API page (blob 985bbeaa…), each re-wrapped with its own count.
  ``night-2`` carries one labelled edit, document 2026-22019's relayed comment count 0 -> 3, so a re-read row changes.
- ``expected/``: the public tables the receipt route published from them (the Register table after each night, and
  the docket links built from each), written by this test's own route at the commit that promoted the columns,
  and held there by ``test_the_receipt_route_...``.

What this cannot see: the live prior is ``regulations-native-v2`` (three more columns than this v1 cut; the v2 pair
is covered by a synthetic row in tests/test_regulations_receipts.py), 164 rows say nothing about a million, and the
pages are cut, so no window is split and no page repeats a document.
