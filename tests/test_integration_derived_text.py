"""Live integration test for Mirrulations derived-data comment text.

Reads a real comment JSON from the public Mirrulations S3 mirror, flattens it,
then runs the production ``ExtractRecords -> EnrichCommentText`` chain and
asserts the comment's attachment text was pulled straight from the bucket's
``derived-data`` prefix (no PDF download).

ACF-2025-0038-0004 is a Public Submission whose inline ``comment`` is just
"See attached file(s)"; its substance lives in an attachment that Mirrulations
has already extracted. Posted comments are immutable, so the identifiers are
stable.

Marked ``integration`` so it is excluded from the default hermetic suite (see
``addopts`` in pyproject.toml); the "Integration (live data)" workflow runs it
via ``pytest -m integration``. Needs outbound access to the anonymous S3 bucket.
