"""Prepared publication by receipt digest (ss-7lrn).

The operator names the seal by the digest its preparation printed; a publisher under the seal's admission key relies
on that preparation's row admission and restoration, and still hashes every member and original. Each test checks
its claim through something other than the mechanism under test: validator spies, bucket writes, receipt bytes,
and the index entry the publication itself would write.
