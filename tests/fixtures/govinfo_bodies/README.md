# GovInfo package fixtures

The source-retention tests also use the complete `CRPT-119hrpt1` summary and
HTML body copied byte-for-byte from spicy-docs at commit
`5f4720f6338b82597163f946d0cfbcd9ebf7cdb6`. Their upstream fixture provenance
records acquisition on 2026-09-19. This local copy makes no new request.

Four complete, unchanged MODS responses and one summary. The first two MODS,
one per collection the `committee-reports` rollup publishes, exist so
`tests/test_committee_reports.py` can prove `bill_id` is read from the
package's own MODS — the metadata the transform already fetches for every
package, so the linkage costs no request — and that a hearing whose MODS
names bills only as body mentions publishes a NULL rather than one of them.
The other two are the multi-part shapes `tests/test_report_section_refresh.py`
reads (decision 29): `CRPT-119hrpt811`, whose root names only its part 1
(`CRPT-119hrpt811-pt1`, `granuleClass` `FIRSTPART`) and so publishes one row
keyed on that part, and `CRPT-119hrpt455`, whose two parts are both
constituents and so publish two rows replaced as a set. The `CRPT-119hrpt455`
summary lets the real acquirer be driven offline, over that MODS grown to seven
parts, to prove the body budget refuses such a report before any body request.
These U.S. government documents are public domain.

`mods-CRPT-118srpt99.xml` is the one **reduced** file here: the Senate
Budget Committee's report on the 117th Congress, filed in the 118th, whose
MODS keys all 34 root `<bill>` elements -- H.R. 5376, the reconciliation act,
among them -- `congress="118"`. `tests/test_print_citations.py` uses it to
prove the transform keys the print's bills in the Congress the report states
it covers and counts the MODS disagreeing. It is byte-identical to spicy-docs'
`tests/fixtures/document_citations/mods-CRPT-118srpt99.xml`, written by the
same `build_fixtures.py` (receipt
`~/Work/corpora/supply-2026-09-02/receipts/fix-print-citations-2026-09-26/`)
from the 2026-09-26 drift audit's keyless read of
`https://www.govinfo.gov/metadata/pkg/CRPT-118srpt99/mods.xml` (32,601 bytes,

`drift-qualification-2026-09-26/bills-citations/native/`): everything before
the first `<relatedItem>`, then `</mods>`, which drops the 62 constituent
records the MODS reader never reads.

## What each one states about a bill

A GovInfo MODS carries the bills a package relates to as
`<extension><bill congress=".." type=".." number=".." context=".."/>`, and
the `context` attribute is the publisher's own statement of *how*:

- `CRPT-119hrpt1` (a four-page House Rules Committee report) lists four bills:
  H. Res. 53 as `PRIMARY` — the resolution the report accompanies — and
  H. Res. 53 again, S. 5 and H.R. 471 as `OTHER`. The `associatedBills`
  element beside them reads `H. Res. 53, 119th`. Measured live 2026-09-19 on
  the twelve newest reports the `committee-report/119` list route names, the
  `PRIMARY` bill agreed with the route's own `associatedBill[0]` on **12 of
  12**.
- `CHRG-119hhrg63127` (the House Homeland Security hearing *Worldwide Threats
  to the Homeland*) lists H.R. 1 and H.R. 5371, both as `BODY`: bills the
  transcript mentions, not a bill the hearing was held on. Over 50 distinct
  hearings of the `hearing/119` route, **no CHRG MODS carried a `PRIMARY`
  bill** — 10 carried `BODY` or `COVER` mentions, 31 entries in all, the most
  on any one hearing being 11 — and of the 12 hearings whose detail named a
  committee meeting, **none** of those meetings' `relatedItems.bills` named a
  bill. So
  `hearing_transcripts.bill_id` stays NULL, and this fixture is the case that
  proves a mention is not promoted to a linkage.

**Both measurements are retained**, with every request and every raw response,
at `~/Work/corpora/supply-2026-09-02/receipts/report-bill-linkage-2026-09-19/`
— 146 requests, with its own README stating the method and the per-package
verdicts. The restatements elsewhere in this repository (the transform
docstring, the two dictionary entries and `PLAN.md`) cite that receipt rather
than re-deriving the numbers.

Offline tests establish behavior for these shapes; they do not establish
coverage or continuing live availability. Replace the CRPT file only by
re-copying from the spicy-docs release this repository pins.
