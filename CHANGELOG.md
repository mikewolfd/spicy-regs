## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **`gao_reports`: GAO's major-rule reports from 1996, and what each report's
  letter states of its rule** (owner decisions 2026-10-04; SpicyDocs 0.56.0's
  readers).
  - **Rows.** A run given finished walks of GAO's "Reports on Major Rules"
    (`GAO_MAJOR_RULE_RUN`) and of its index of 2000-12-15
    (`GAO_MAJOR_RULE_OLD_INDEX_RUN`), with the Month in Review walk
    (`GAO_LISTING_RUN`), adds the major-rule reports of 1996 to 2008 under the
    routes `gao_major_rule_listing` and `gao_major_rule_index`, and the AIMD-
    and GGD- products that listing also states as ordinary rows. A title the
    Month in Review cut is made whole, and a report GAO's listings state is
    labelled Federal Agency Major Rule Report whatever route holds its row.
  - **Columns.** `major_rule_agency`, `major_rule_rins` and
    `major_rule_fr_citations`, read from each report's letter in a capture
    named by `GAO_MAJOR_RULE_LETTERS`. The lists are not pairs. A blank is NULL
    and its reason is in the row's receipt, with each value's place in the
    letter. `gao_reports` moves to policy `government-sources/2`; a prior
    published under `/1` is read once and rewritten.

### Changed

- **SpicyDocs 0.52.0, adopting 0.51.0 with it** (main `b08ac1b`, wheel
  `374b8c20`). What each release entry asks of an importer, and what moves:

  - **Stages.** `congress_bills.stage` and `bill_actions.stage` read a bill's
    actions in publisher order, with `failed` and `vetoed` stages and a
    "Became law" label. Replayed on the live generation of 2026-09-29, 154,374
    of the 172,991 stages with actions move once each bill's Congress is
    re-read (92,981 `introduced` to `committee`, 49,264 `other_chamber` to
    `committee`, 5,682 `committee` to `other_chamber`). None emits a
    `stage_changed` event: a prior stage is re-derived from the bill's
    published actions under the running rule before events compare (owner,
    2026-09-28), so only a bill whose actions moved emits one.
  - **CBO for every Congress.** Each run reads CBO's keyless feed once for
    every Congress it is scoped to and merges its rows (`source` `cbo_feed`)
    with the BILLSTATUS rows, BILLSTATUS keeping every identity both state,
    against this run's rows and the prior ones. `title_bill_id`, `found_by`
    and `title_bill_id_rule` are appended. The published `laws` table names
    a law's bill for a title led by a law. Through this host's code, over
    the retained 108th-119th feeds and zips with the live table as prior
    (bill-family `a42bd610`, 12,740 rows), the merge adds 2,043 rows (913
    and 1,101 in the 112th and 113th, 29 elsewhere) and changes or drops no
    BILLSTATUS row. spicy-docs' receipt counts 2,048: the other five are two
    feed items titled by a 110th or 112th law, which `laws` (the 119th only,
    today) cannot name a bill for, and three 119th estimates the live
    BILLSTATUS record now lists itself.
  - **Votes.** `roll_call_votes` appends `clerk_body_element` and `vote_desc`.
    The 101st-107th House backfill (7,327 Clerk files, 1990-2002) is a
    dispatch of `rollup-roll-call-votes` with `chambers=house` and a per-run
    `max_votes` cap: replayed over the retained archive it adds 7,327 roll
    calls and 3,175,523 `name:`-keyed member rows with NULL `bioguide_id`. A
    `name:` key identifies a row within its vote, not a person, and
    `member_vote_terms` leaves it unresolved. The five votes vacated before
    any position was recorded publish a row with no member rows.
  - **Digests.** Every published digest is spelled `sha256:`, and spicy-docs
    compares them strictly. `enrich_pdf` writes each attempt's
    `source_sha256` prefixed, and a derived attachment's `sha256` arrives
    prefixed. The prior bare values are re-spelled once
    (`prior_repairs`, below); a bill-family run refuses a bare
    `bill_summaries.content_hash` rather than compare it.
  - **Native legal references.** The two tables are spicy-docs contracts:
    its shapers and its reading of each observation, with this repository's
    target lookup passed in as `resolve`. The first republish moves every
    row's `rule_version` to `native-legal-reference/003`, re-spells 14
    `target_candidates_json` values and re-versions 51 candidates in 31 rows,
    and nothing else (rebuilt from the retained manifest and compared).
  - **The Record.** `record_issues.package_id` is the part-1 whole-issue
    link's stem (`entire_issue_url_stem/2`); a one-time rebuild moves the 7
    `-bk{N}` ids of 368 held rows to the packages GovInfo holds.
  - **Comments.** The contract appends `subtype` and `duplicate_comments`.
    This host does not write them yet: `tests/test_contract_tables.py` names
    them as pending (`PENDING_RECORD_COLUMNS`), and the comments-fields branch
    adds the host columns and empties that entry.

- **A bill-family status read that settles nothing is recorded, not repeated
  every run.** A document the reader refuses, a bill whose rows leave its
  status in doubt, and a bill its folder's zip no longer holds are recorded
  with the zip and the reader (`bill_family_archives` metadata,
  `status_refusals.v1`), and the folder completes (`completed_archive_scopes.v4`,
  which reads v3 too). None reopens its folder until the zip moves or another
  reader runs. On the live generation of 2026-09-29, 26 bills of the
  108th-111th and 117th reopened ten folders on every run that scoped them.
  A pre-108th bill filled from the detail route records its reader too, and
  one another reader filled is re-read once, within the run's fetch cap; a
  detail refused after it was shaped waits for its list stamp or reader to
  move instead of costing a request every run.

- **One-time repairs for the adoption** (`python -m
  spicy_regs.pipelines.prior_repairs`), each a partial writer of its family,
  idempotent, with a `--dry-run` that writes nothing and a `restore` rollback.
  Dry runs against the live generations of 2026-09-29:
  `respell-bill-family-digests` 0 (no model rows are published);
  `respell-document-digests` 0; `respell-comment-digests` 366,541 digests in
  330,236 comments of 140 agencies, through the catalog (workflow
  `respell-comment-digests`); `backfill-found-by` 12,740 rows;
  `rebuild-record-issues` 7 package ids and 368 rules; `stage-suppression`
  154,374 stages, no events. A partial writer now carries a split sibling
  (`bill_sections`) member for member, so the bill family takes one.

- **The bill family skips an unchanged bill only when the running reader read
  it.** Each bill's status reader, this rollup's status rule (`status-v1`) and
  the SpicyDocs package digest, is recorded per bill in
  `bill_family_archives`' metadata. A SpicyDocs release that changes the code
  re-reads every bill of a Congress on that Congress's next run, and a
  version-only release re-reads none. Bumping `status-v1` does the same for a
  change to spicy-regs' own status pass. A re-read does not replace every older
  value. `congress_bills` merges column-wise, so a value the new reader leaves
  NULL keeps the old one. A bill whose cosponsor rows are refused keeps its
  prior rows, and CBO rows are replaced only on a listed outcome. Bills before
  the 108th, filled from the API detail route, record no reader.

  Expected effect: every bill with no recorded reader has its BILLSTATUS read
  once more on its Congress's next run, and no printing is fetched again. Runs
  36371298463 (the 113th, 10,637 bills) and 36375716128 (the 108th–112th,
  63,747 bills) measured 4.2 to 7.8 ms a bill all in, or 2.5 to 6.4 ms after
  the folder listings. The 119th nightly re-reads its 19,249 bills once, about
  1 to 2 minutes more. A 113th–118th run re-reads about 90,000 bills in about
  6 to 11 minutes of status pass. Only the 113th's 10,637 are extra because of
  this change: the 114th–118th lack the CBO and cosponsor outcomes and were due
  for a full re-read anyway. The 108th–112th's 63,747 re-read on their next
  scoped run.

- **SpicyDocs 0.50.1.** `house_communications` derives all four RIN columns of
  every read row from its retained `report_nature` on each run, not only
  `rin_occurrences_json`, so a row no run re-reads moves with the reader too.
  Replayed over the published table (5,006 rows): 2,040 rows' `rin_rule`
  becomes `report_nature_rin_label/2`, 2 go from `unmatched` to it, and 3 go to
  `unmatched`. Those 3 are the NOAA RINs read cut short (119-EC-1226, 1544 and
  1649), whose `rin` and `rin_matched_text` become NULL. 119-EC-602 and 1209
  gain `2120-AA64`. 1,559 rows' `rin_occurrences_json` is respelled compact
  and key-sorted, as the shaper spells it, with the same value. On each bill's
  re-read, `bill_cosponsors.source_xml` loses the whitespace after `</item>`,
  and each of the 108th–111th's 4,762 `cbo_cost_estimates` rows gains its http
  twin as a restatement (`stated_count` 2).

- **`proceedings.agency_code` follows RefSpec's agency registry for docket-less
  proceedings** (proceedings v11, RefSpec 0.1.0.dev21's registry view, batch
  1). A Register agency bridged to an organization a Regulations.gov code
  selects takes that code (Energy Department: DOE; Labor Department: DOL). A
  renamed agency takes its current successor's code whatever the document's
  date: a 1998 Health Care Finance Administration notice is CMS, and an Export
  Administration Bureau rule of any year is BIS. A split agency takes a code
  only when every current successor has one and they agree; none of batch 1's
  four splits does (INS, Customs Service, ICC, USIA). Expected effect over the
  live snapshot's 97,472 docket-less proceedings: 1,186 gain a code, 729 change
  code and none lose one, so 90,848 carry a code, up from 89,662. The changes
  are HHS to CMS 467, DOC to BIS 163, DOC to EAB 84, TREAS to IIO 11, HHS to
  ACL 2 and HHS to HHSIG 2. Docketed proceedings, and so lifecycles, do not
  change.

- **A defunct agency's department is the one RefSpec's registry view states**
  (view schema 1.1, RefSpec cd78e476; proceedings stay v11). The rule reads
  each renamed or split agency's roster parent from the view's
  `original_parents`, no longer from the `parent_id` its Register entry names.
  On the live Register the two agree for all 9 such agencies, so no code moves:
  none of 1,009,313 rows, and none of snapshot b22d81c4's proceedings replayed.

- **`document_attributes` and `docket_attributes` break a `modifyDate` tie by
  SpicyDocs' write-time rule** (document policy 1.3, spicy-docs 0.45.1). Among
  a record's mirror copies tied at the newest `modifyDate`, the copy written
  more than an hour after every other wins; otherwise the smallest SpicyDocs
  record digest wins. The higher attributes digest decided before. Expected
  effect, from the next attributes-sweep publish: about 8
  `document_attributes` rows mirror-wide. The 27 agencies measured on
  2026-09-27 hold 6 `open_for_comment` flips: false to true for
  DEA-2023-0148-0026, USA-2022-HQ-0007-0002, CMS-2023-0069-0001 and
  EPA-HQ-OMS-2021-0325-0002; true to false for EPA-R09-OAR-2018-0160-0007 and
  FWS-R4-ES-2023-0037-0001. No docket rows and no thin-table rows change.

## [2026.08.26]

The headline of this cycle: the MCP server moved off Vercel onto **Cloud Run**,
where it is load-tested to **100 concurrent users at ~0% errors**, and the
deployment itself became infrastructure-as-code under a new `deploy/` folder.
Along the way the **FCC** joined the corpus as its own two tables, and a pass
over "how do I actually use this data" turned up — and fixed — several
documented access paths that did not work.

### Added

- **FCC ECFS** ingestion — `fcc_proceedings` and `fcc_filings`, the FCC's docket
  and comment equivalents for the rulemaking that never reaches
  regulations.gov ([#149]).
- **Cloud Run** as the primary MCP host, captured as a reproducible deploy
  script plus a runbook for the billing-quota and org-policy hurdles
  ([#164]).
- **`deploy/` folder with Terraform IaC** for the R2 bucket, its
  `data.spicy-regs.dev` domain, CORS, the Iceberg catalog, and the edge cache
  rule — import-first, so it adopts existing production rather than recreating
  it ([#159]); Terraform state moved into a private R2 bucket over the `s3`
  backend with native locking ([#161]).
- **Cloudflare Containers** deploy, authored in [#159] and made actually
  deployable in [#162] (build context, generated Worker bindings); kept as the
  documented single-instance fallback.
- **Cloudflare purge-on-publish** (`sources/cloudflare.py`), a no-op without
  credentials and never able to fail a publish that already wrote its data
  ([#158]).
- Docs: `mcp-server/INTERNALS.md` as the committed home for server rationale
  ([#153]); a README reworked into a project front page ([#150]); a
  `getting_started.ipynb` covering the rollups, the non-core tables, and
  cross-source joins ([#156]).

### Changed

- **Performance:** the MCP server caches its DuckDB connection across tool
  calls instead of reinstalling extensions, reattaching the catalog, and
  recreating 20 views per request — **34.5s → 0.21s** warm ([#157]).
- **`.env` loads in CLI entry points, not at import time**, so importing the
  package no longer mutates `os.environ`; one AST test locks it in ([#155]).
- The public corpus hostname is `data.spicy-regs.dev` ([#150]).
- **MCP:** all code comments moved out of the server modules into
  `INTERNALS.md`, keeping the `@mcp.tool()` docstrings that FastMCP reflects
  over to build client-facing tool descriptions ([#153]).
- **Vercel:** pinned `mcp<2` and raised `maxDuration` to the real 800s Pro
  ceiling ([#151], [#152]) — both superseded when that deploy was retired
  ([#166]).

### Removed

- The **Vercel MCP deployment** and its dependency-light parallel copy of the
  server, now that `mcp.spicy-regs.dev` points at Cloud Run running the
  canonical `spicy_regs.mcp_server` ([#166]).

### Fixed

- **Parquet must be `no-cache`.** Edge-caching it corrupts DuckDB's concurrent
  byte-range reads — observed as decode and ETag-mismatch errors from ~c=10 on
  a revision that otherwise ran c=100 cleanly. Reverted the [#158] cache policy
  for Parquet ([#165]) and set the Terraform-managed cache rule to
  `enabled = false` so an apply cannot re-enable it ([#167]). Non-Parquet
  artifacts, which DuckDB never reads, stay cacheable.
- **The `spicy-regs` CLI was broken end to end** — Cloudflare 403s the default
  urllib User-Agent, so `download`, `stats`, `sample`, `search`, and `agencies`
  all failed; downloads now stream to a `.partial` sibling so a truncated write
  can't masquerade as a complete one. Also repointed the published query docs
  off a comments tree that no longer gets written, and added
  `--discover-from-derived` so the comment-text backfill can see the 99.8% of
  rows the `attachments_json` gate hid from it ([#156]).
- **Unit tests were downloading the production corpus** — a developer's `.env`
  reached "hermetic" tests through an import-time `load_dotenv()`, making them
  838s locally and green-by-accident in CI ([#154]).

## [2026.07.22]

The headline of this cycle: the pipeline went from mirroring regulations.gov and
the Federal Register to ingesting **ten complementary federal data sources**, so
the full rulemaking lifecycle — the organizations that engage in it and its
downstream context — can be queried from one place. Alongside the new sources,
this cycle hardened the rollups and made the published corpus edge-cacheable.

### Added

- **Federal Register** ingestion brought fully in-repo ([#125]).
- **Unified Agenda** (RegInfo) ingestion — `unified_agenda` ([#126]).
- **Congress.gov** bill ingestion — `congress_bills` ([#127]).
- **GovInfo CFR** section ingestion — `cfr_sections` ([#128]).
- **OpenFEC** committees ingestion — `fec_committees` ([#132]).
- **Senate Lobbying Disclosure (LDA)** filings ingestion — `lobbying_filings` ([#133]).
- **SAM.gov** entity registry ingestion — `sam_entities` ([#134]).
- **USASpending** recipients ingestion — `usaspending_recipients` ([#135]).
- **CourtListener** litigation ingestion — `court_dockets` ([#137]).
- **GAO + CRS** reports ingestion — `gao_reports`, `crs_reports` ([#138]).
- Docs: a Python query walkthrough ([#142]) and a refreshed table catalog for
  the eleven new data sources ([#139]).

### Changed

- **Performance:** made the R2 parquet corpus edge-cacheable and pruned docket
  scans ([#124]).
- **SAM.gov:** upgraded to full-coverage ingestion via a partitioned walk ([#141]).
- **OpenFEC:** switched to keyset pagination to walk all committees ([#136]).
- **Unified Agenda:** now fetches and parses the real `REGINFO_RIN_DATA` XML
  export ([#131]).
- **CFR:** use the GovInfo `/published` endpoint and derive section fields from
  IDs ([#130]).
- **Congress.gov:** drop the always-null `policy_area` (the list endpoint omits
  it) ([#129]).
- **CI:** schedule weekly comments-catalog compaction and serialize catalog
  writers ([#145]); forward `SAM_API_KEY` to rollup jobs ([#140]).

### Fixed

- Harden the external-source rollups ([#147]).
- Dedup the catalog comments view on read ([#143]).
- Sub-batch catalog dedup by key hash to avoid runner OOM ([#123]).
- Matrix sweep + full agency coverage to stop batch starvation ([#121]).
- Stop marking failed downloads as processed in the ETL manifest ([#120]).
