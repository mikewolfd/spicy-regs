## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **`document_attributes` and `docket_attributes` break a `modifyDate` tie by
  SpicyDocs' write-time rule** (document policy 1.3, spicy-docs 0.45.1). Among
  a record's mirror copies tied at the newest `modifyDate`, the copy written
  more than an hour after every other wins; otherwise the smallest SpicyDocs
  record digest wins. The higher attributes digest decided before. Expected
  effect, from the next attributes-sweep publish: about 8
  `document_attributes` rows mirror-wide. The 27 agencies measured on
  2026-09-27 hold 6 `open_for_comment` flips: false to true for
  DEA-2023-0148-0026, USA-2022-HQ-0007-0002, CMS-2023-0069-0001 and
  EPA-HQ-OMS-2021-0325-0002; true to false for EPA-R09-OAR-2018-0160-0007 and
  FWS-R4-ES-2023-0037-0001. No docket rows and no thin-table rows change.

## [2026.08.26]

The headline of this cycle: the MCP server moved off Vercel onto **Cloud Run**,
where it is load-tested to **100 concurrent users at ~0% errors**, and the
deployment itself became infrastructure-as-code under a new `deploy/` folder.
Along the way the **FCC** joined the corpus as its own two tables, and a pass
over "how do I actually use this data" turned up — and fixed — several
documented access paths that did not work.

### Added

- **FCC ECFS** ingestion — `fcc_proceedings` and `fcc_filings`, the FCC's docket
  and comment equivalents for the rulemaking that never reaches
  regulations.gov ([#149]).
- **Cloud Run** as the primary MCP host, captured as a reproducible deploy
  script plus a runbook for the billing-quota and org-policy hurdles
  ([#164]).
- **`deploy/` folder with Terraform IaC** for the R2 bucket, its
  `data.spicy-regs.dev` domain, CORS, the Iceberg catalog, and the edge cache
  rule — import-first, so it adopts existing production rather than recreating
  it ([#159]); Terraform state moved into a private R2 bucket over the `s3`
  backend with native locking ([#161]).
- **Cloudflare Containers** deploy, authored in [#159] and made actually
  deployable in [#162] (build context, generated Worker bindings); kept as the
  documented single-instance fallback.
- **Cloudflare purge-on-publish** (`sources/cloudflare.py`), a no-op without
  credentials and never able to fail a publish that already wrote its data
  ([#158]).
- Docs: `mcp-server/INTERNALS.md` as the committed home for server rationale
  ([#153]); a README reworked into a project front page ([#150]); a
  `getting_started.ipynb` covering the rollups, the non-core tables, and
  cross-source joins ([#156]).

### Changed

- **Performance:** the MCP server caches its DuckDB connection across tool
  calls instead of reinstalling extensions, reattaching the catalog, and
  recreating 20 views per request — **34.5s → 0.21s** warm ([#157]).
- **`.env` loads in CLI entry points, not at import time**, so importing the
  package no longer mutates `os.environ`; one AST test locks it in ([#155]).
- The public corpus hostname is `data.spicy-regs.dev` ([#150]).
- **MCP:** all code comments moved out of the server modules into
  `INTERNALS.md`, keeping the `@mcp.tool()` docstrings that FastMCP reflects
  over to build client-facing tool descriptions ([#153]).
- **Vercel:** pinned `mcp<2` and raised `maxDuration` to the real 800s Pro
  ceiling ([#151], [#152]) — both superseded when that deploy was retired
  ([#166]).

### Removed

- The **Vercel MCP deployment** and its dependency-light parallel copy of the
  server, now that `mcp.spicy-regs.dev` points at Cloud Run running the
  canonical `spicy_regs.mcp_server` ([#166]).

### Fixed

- **Parquet must be `no-cache`.** Edge-caching it corrupts DuckDB's concurrent
  byte-range reads — observed as decode and ETag-mismatch errors from ~c=10 on
  a revision that otherwise ran c=100 cleanly. Reverted the [#158] cache policy
  for Parquet ([#165]) and set the Terraform-managed cache rule to
  `enabled = false` so an apply cannot re-enable it ([#167]). Non-Parquet
  artifacts, which DuckDB never reads, stay cacheable.
- **The `spicy-regs` CLI was broken end to end** — Cloudflare 403s the default
  urllib User-Agent, so `download`, `stats`, `sample`, `search`, and `agencies`
  all failed; downloads now stream to a `.partial` sibling so a truncated write
  can't masquerade as a complete one. Also repointed the published query docs
  off a comments tree that no longer gets written, and added
  `--discover-from-derived` so the comment-text backfill can see the 99.8% of
  rows the `attachments_json` gate hid from it ([#156]).
- **Unit tests were downloading the production corpus** — a developer's `.env`
  reached "hermetic" tests through an import-time `load_dotenv()`, making them
  838s locally and green-by-accident in CI ([#154]).

## [2026.07.22]

The headline of this cycle: the pipeline went from mirroring regulations.gov and
the Federal Register to ingesting **ten complementary federal data sources**, so
the full rulemaking lifecycle — the organizations that engage in it and its
downstream context — can be queried from one place. Alongside the new sources,
this cycle hardened the rollups and made the published corpus edge-cacheable.

### Added

- **Federal Register** ingestion brought fully in-repo ([#125]).
- **Unified Agenda** (RegInfo) ingestion — `unified_agenda` ([#126]).
- **Congress.gov** bill ingestion — `congress_bills` ([#127]).
- **GovInfo CFR** section ingestion — `cfr_sections` ([#128]).
- **OpenFEC** committees ingestion — `fec_committees` ([#132]).
- **Senate Lobbying Disclosure (LDA)** filings ingestion — `lobbying_filings` ([#133]).
- **SAM.gov** entity registry ingestion — `sam_entities` ([#134]).
- **USASpending** recipients ingestion — `usaspending_recipients` ([#135]).
- **CourtListener** litigation ingestion — `court_dockets` ([#137]).
- **GAO + CRS** reports ingestion — `gao_reports`, `crs_reports` ([#138]).
- Docs: a Python query walkthrough ([#142]) and a refreshed table catalog for
  the eleven new data sources ([#139]).

### Changed

- **Performance:** made the R2 parquet corpus edge-cacheable and pruned docket
  scans ([#124]).
- **SAM.gov:** upgraded to full-coverage ingestion via a partitioned walk ([#141]).
- **OpenFEC:** switched to keyset pagination to walk all committees ([#136]).
- **Unified Agenda:** now fetches and parses the real `REGINFO_RIN_DATA` XML
  export ([#131]).
- **CFR:** use the GovInfo `/published` endpoint and derive section fields from
  IDs ([#130]).
- **Congress.gov:** drop the always-null `policy_area` (the list endpoint omits
  it) ([#129]).
- **CI:** schedule weekly comments-catalog compaction and serialize catalog
  writers ([#145]); forward `SAM_API_KEY` to rollup jobs ([#140]).

### Fixed

- Harden the external-source rollups ([#147]).
- Dedup the catalog comments view on read ([#143]).
- Sub-batch catalog dedup by key hash to avoid runner OOM ([#123]).
- Matrix sweep + full agency coverage to stop batch starvation ([#121]).
- Stop marking failed downloads as processed in the ETL manifest ([#120]).
