## Unreleased — local ontology and document-AI candidate

This work exists only in the local candidate. It has not been published,
released, or deployed.

### Added

- A RIN now identifies a durable regulatory agenda item. New
  `regulatory_agenda_items` and `agenda_item_proceedings` outputs keep agenda
  observations and independently identified Proceedings distinct.
- Official Supreme Court PDF opinion packages provide a seventeenth ontology
  subject profile and real long-form judicial documents. Each package remains
  one artifact until source-backed structure can separate authored opinions
  reliably.
- Source-aware elements, bounded segments, document-only acceptance scope,
  resumable provider calls, dense and sparse retrieval experiments, hybrid
  fusion, cross-encoder reranking, and scoped OpenAI tagging complete the
  bounded document-AI comparison.

### Deferred beyond the comparison-ready milestone

- Broader production certification, migration, a larger legal gold set,
  operational hardening, and independent review.
- oMLX evaluation and extended reranker candidate-depth sweeps, which were
  intentionally excluded from this milestone.
- A released Rulespec rulemaking contract and non-originating consumer review.

## [2026.07.22]

The headline of this cycle: the pipeline went from mirroring regulations.gov and
the Federal Register to ingesting **ten complementary federal data sources**, so
the full rulemaking lifecycle — the organizations that engage in it and its
downstream context — can be queried from one place. Alongside the new sources,
this cycle hardened the rollups and made the published corpus edge-cacheable.

### Added

- **Federal Register** ingestion brought fully in-repo ([#125]).
- **Unified Agenda** (RegInfo) ingestion — `unified_agenda` ([#126]).
- **Congress.gov** bill ingestion — `congress_bills` ([#127]).
- **GovInfo CFR** section ingestion — `cfr_sections` ([#128]).
- **OpenFEC** committees ingestion — `fec_committees` ([#132]).
- **Senate Lobbying Disclosure (LDA)** filings ingestion — `lobbying_filings` ([#133]).
- **SAM.gov** entity registry ingestion — `sam_entities` ([#134]).
- **USASpending** recipients ingestion — `usaspending_recipients` ([#135]).
- **CourtListener** litigation ingestion — `court_dockets` ([#137]).
- **GAO + CRS** reports ingestion — `gao_reports`, `crs_reports` ([#138]).
- Docs: a Python query walkthrough ([#142]) and a refreshed table catalog for
  the eleven new data sources ([#139]).

### Changed

- **Performance:** made the R2 parquet corpus edge-cacheable and pruned docket
  scans ([#124]).
- **SAM.gov:** upgraded to full-coverage ingestion via a partitioned walk ([#141]).
- **OpenFEC:** switched to keyset pagination to walk all committees ([#136]).
- **Unified Agenda:** now fetches and parses the real `REGINFO_RIN_DATA` XML
  export ([#131]).
- **CFR:** use the GovInfo `/published` endpoint and derive section fields from
  IDs ([#130]).
- **Congress.gov:** drop the always-null `policy_area` (the list endpoint omits
  it) ([#129]).
- **CI:** schedule weekly comments-catalog compaction and serialize catalog
  writers ([#145]); forward `SAM_API_KEY` to rollup jobs ([#140]).

### Fixed

- Harden the external-source rollups ([#147]).
- Dedup the catalog comments view on read ([#143]).
- Sub-batch catalog dedup by key hash to avoid runner OOM ([#123]).
- Matrix sweep + full agency coverage to stop batch starvation ([#121]).
- Stop marking failed downloads as processed in the ETL manifest ([#120]).
