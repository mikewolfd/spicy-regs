# Spicy Regs Data Dictionary

This is the schema reference for the **Spicy Regs** dataset — an open mirror of
[regulations.gov](https://www.regulations.gov) federal regulatory data,
published as Apache Parquet on a public Cloudflare R2 bucket.

It documents every published table, column by column. The schema is generated
directly from the code that defines and produces the data, and a CI check fails
whenever the schema and these descriptions drift apart — so this reference stays
in step with what's actually published.

## Where the data comes from

```
regulations.gov  →  Mirrulations S3 mirror  →  Spicy Regs ETL  →  Parquet on R2
                                                                   (data.spicy-regs.dev)
```

The ETL flattens the raw regulations.gov JSON into a handful of flat tables and
publishes them, plus small pre-computed rollups, to `https://data.spicy-regs.dev`.
Alongside them it ingests a set of **complementary federal data sources** — the
Federal Register, the Unified Agenda, Congress.gov, the CFR, SAM.gov, lobbying
disclosures, the FEC, USASpending, federal-court litigation, and GAO/CRS reports
— so the rulemaking lifecycle, the organizations that engage in it, and its
downstream context can all be queried from one place.

## The tables

Every table below is published as `https://data.spicy-regs.dev/<name>.parquet` and
is queryable through the MCP server (`list_sources` / `describe_table` /
`query_sql`).

## How the tables relate

The three core tables form a simple hierarchy keyed by id:

```
dockets (docket_id)
  └── documents (document_id, docket_id →)
  └── comments  (comment_id,  docket_id →)
```

- `documents.docket_id` and `comments.docket_id` reference `dockets.docket_id`.
- `agency_code` appears on every table and is the join key for the agency rollups.
- The rollups (`comments_index`, `feed_summary`, `agency_stats`,
  `agency_monthly_volume`) are pre-aggregated views built from the three core
  tables so consumers don't have to scan the tens-of-millions-of-rows comments
  dataset.

The complementary sources are **reference tables** rather than strict children
of `dockets`; they join to the corpus (and to each other) on a few shared keys:

- **RIN** (Regulation Identifier Number) links `unified_agenda` (the planned
  action) to `federal_register.regulation_id_numbers_json` (the published rule).
- **CFR citations** link `cfr_sections` to `federal_register.cfr_references_json`
  and `unified_agenda.cfr_references_json` (the codified text a rule amends).
- **Docket IDs** in `federal_register.docket_ids_json` tie FR documents back to
  regulations.gov dockets.
- **UEI** (Unique Entity ID) links `sam_entities` and `usaspending_recipients`,
  and is the anchor for resolving commenter/organization names to a canonical
  entity.
- **Organization name** bridges the softer influence sources — `lobbying_filings`
  (registrant/client), `fec_committees`, and comment filers — where no shared id
  exists. For `fec_committees` that bridge is now materialized:
  [`org_committee_links`](tables/org_committee_links.md) resolves
  `comments.organization` to `committee_id` once, with `match_method` /
  `confidence` on every row, so consumers stop re-inventing the normalization.
- **`agency_code` / agency name** appears across nearly every table.

> Coverage notes: `sam_entities` covers the active public registry (~885K rows;
> chunked ingestion walks SAM's bulk extract by `registrationDate` year window
> across runs), `lobbying_filings` covers 2024-onward, `usaspending_recipients`
> is the top ~100K recipients by award amount, `org_committee_links` is bounded
> by the ~0.08% of comments that carry an `organization` value at all, and
> `gao_reports` tracks GAO's
> recent-items RSS window (it grows as the daily job runs). Each table page
> notes its own scope.

## How to query it

=== "AI assistant (MCP)"

    The hosted MCP server exposes `list_sources`, `describe_table`, and
    `query_sql` over all of the tables above. Add
    `https://mcp.spicy-regs.dev/mcp` as a connector, or run it locally:

    ```bash
    claude mcp add spicy-regs -- uvx --from "spicy-regs @ git+https://github.com/civictechdc/spicy-regs" spicy-regs-mcp
    ```

=== "CLI"

    ```bash
    uvx --from "spicy-regs @ git+https://github.com/civictechdc/spicy-regs" spicy-regs download
    uv run spicy-regs stats
    ```

=== "DuckDB (SQL)"

    ```sql
    INSTALL httpfs; LOAD httpfs;
    SELECT agency_code, COUNT(*) AS dockets
    FROM read_parquet('https://data.spicy-regs.dev/dockets.parquet')
    GROUP BY agency_code
    ORDER BY dockets DESC
    LIMIT 20;
    ```

=== "Python"

    ```python
    import duckdb
    con = duckdb.connect()
    con.execute("INSTALL httpfs; LOAD httpfs")
    con.execute(
        "SELECT agency_code, docket_count "
        "FROM read_parquet('https://data.spicy-regs.dev/agency_stats.parquet') "
        "ORDER BY docket_count DESC LIMIT 20"
    ).df()   # -> pandas DataFrame
    ```

    See **[Querying with Python](querying-python.md)** for a full walkthrough,
    including cross-source joins (RIN, UEI) and working with the large
    `comments` table.

!!! note "Keeping this current"
    Column names and types are the source of truth in code
    (`RECORD_TYPES` for the core tables, `DERIVED_SCHEMAS` for the rollups). The
    prose lives in `data_dictionary/descriptions.yaml`. Run
    `uv run spicy-regs-dict generate` to rebuild the table pages, and
    `uv run spicy-regs-dict check` to verify the two are in sync — the same
    check runs in CI on every pull request.
