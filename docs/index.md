# Spicy Regs Data Dictionary

This is the schema reference for the **Spicy Regs** dataset — an open mirror of
[regulations.gov](https://www.regulations.gov) federal regulatory data,
published as Apache Parquet on a public Cloudflare R2 bucket.

It documents every table supported by the current code, column by column.
Tables awaiting their first production generation are marked below. The schema
is generated directly from the code that defines and produces the data, and a
CI check fails whenever the schema and these descriptions drift apart.

## Where the data comes from

```
regulations.gov  →  Mirrulations S3 mirror  →  Spicy Regs ETL  →  Parquet on R2
                                                                   (data.spicy-regs.dev)
```

The ETL flattens the raw regulations.gov JSON into a handful of flat tables and
publishes them, plus small pre-computed rollups, to `https://data.spicy-regs.dev`.
Alongside them it ingests a set of **complementary federal data sources** — the
Federal Register, the Unified Agenda, Congress.gov, the CFR, SAM.gov, lobbying
disclosures, the FEC, USASpending, federal-court litigation, and GAO/CRS reports
— so the rulemaking lifecycle, the organizations that engage in it, and its
downstream context can all be queried from one place.

## The tables

Most tables below use the stable object
`https://data.spicy-regs.dev/<name>.parquet`. The nine rule-identity and ontology
tables publish together under an immutable snapshot prefix; clients resolve
`materialized/ontology/latest.json` and use the artifact URLs in its manifest.
The MCP server (`list_sources` / `describe_table` / `query_sql`) performs that
resolution automatically and never mixes ontology generations.

## How the tables relate

The three core tables form a simple hierarchy keyed by id:

```
dockets (docket_id)
  └── documents (document_id, docket_id →)
  └── comments  (comment_id,  docket_id →)
```

- `documents.docket_id` and `comments.docket_id` reference `dockets.docket_id`.
- `agency_code` appears on every table and is the join key for the agency rollups.
- The rollups (`comments_index`, `feed_summary`, `agency_stats`,
  `agency_monthly_volume`) are pre-aggregated views built from the three core
  tables so consumers don't have to scan the tens-of-millions-of-rows comments
  dataset.

The complementary sources join through normalized identity tables:

- **`rule_targets`** normalizes RIN, CFR, Federal Register, document, and docket
  evidence while preserving corroborating sources as separate rows.
- **`authority_edges`** parses U.S.C. and Public Law citations without dropping
  failed parses; `pl_number` joins enacted authorities to `congress_bills`.
- **`proceedings`** threads stages and documents without assuming that a reused
  RIN is globally unique; **`comment_periods`** carries extensions and reopenings.
- **`concept_assignments`** connects dockets/documents to the append-only
  **`concepts`** registry, with provenance and validation history in every row.
- **UEI** (Unique Entity ID) links `sam_entities` and `usaspending_recipients`,
  and is the anchor for resolving commenter/organization names to a canonical
  entity.
- **Organization name** bridges the softer influence sources — `lobbying_filings`
  (registrant/client), `fec_committees`, and comment filers — where no shared id
  exists.
- **`agency_code` / agency name** appears across nearly every table.

The compact identifiers, provenance mapping, and Rulespec Level-0 posture are
documented in [Ontology and Rulespec L0](ontology.md). The
[document segmentation research](ontology-segmentation-research.md) defines the
source-aware chunking policy for LLM tagging and retrieval. The
[RIN ontology revision report](rin-ontology-revision-report.md) records the
current local agenda-item/Proceeding corpus result. The
[mixed real-data corpus report](mixed-real-data-corpus-report.md) remains the
pre-segmentation, 18-source OpenAI baseline.

### Current design and evidence map

- The [production segmentation goal](superpowers/specs/2026-07-24-production-document-segmentation-agent-goal.md)
  is the completed comparison-ready ledger. Its bounded model receipts and
  repository gates pass; broader production certification remains deferred.
- The [segment carrier decision](superpowers/specs/2026-07-24-document-segmentation-carrier-decision.md)
  and [package-fit decision](superpowers/specs/2026-07-24-document-ai-package-fit-decision.md)
  define the current implementation boundary.
- The [RIN revision goal](superpowers/specs/2026-07-24-rin-ontology-revision-agent-goal.md)
  and [RIN corpus report](rin-ontology-revision-report.md) define the current
  local rulemaking candidate. Rulespec remains Experimental and unpublished.
- The [relationship assertion and exclusion decision](superpowers/specs/2026-07-24-relation-exclusion-findings-design.md)
  records the general assertion kernel, the bounded OpenAI diagnostic, and the
  v2 benchmark requirements. V1 is reproducible but is not a fair
  model-comparison instrument.
- The [v2 human adjudication protocol](superpowers/specs/2026-07-25-relation-exclusion-v2-human-adjudication-protocol.md)
  defines the exposed-development-case rules and the sealed, model-blind review
  gate required before a benchmark-eligible relation-exclusion run.
- The focused
  [proof-certificate v2 receipt](evidence/relation-exclusion-openai-v2-focused-five-proof-certificate-2026-07-25/receipt.json)
  records the five-case development diagnostic that drove claimant,
  conditionality, evidence-boundary, and prompt integration. It is explicitly
  not holdout or provider-comparison evidence.
- The [adversarial review synthesis](evidence/relation-assertion-adversarial-review-2026-07-25.md)
  records which systemic ontology findings were incorporated and which gates
  remain open.
- The [recent document, relation, and lookup research](evidence/recent-document-relation-lookup-research-2026-07-25.md)
  connects the last year's work to the generic work/version seam, four lookup
  classes, bounded absence, and package-first implementation.
- The [bare Codex CLI provider](codex-cli-provider.md) defines the tool-free
  structured-output adapter and its distinct receipt contract.
- The [resolver contract](superpowers/specs/2026-07-25-relation-comparison-resolver-contract.md)
  defines the dependency-inverted comparison and proof boundary.
- The [longitudinal omission design](superpowers/specs/2026-07-25-longitudinal-relation-omission-design.md)
  distinguishes explicit denial, relation change, bounded omission, and
  unknown.
- The [deontic profile boundary](superpowers/specs/2026-07-25-deontic-relation-profile-boundary.md)
  keeps neutral findings separate from regulatory or other domain judgments.
- The [release and migration plan](superpowers/specs/2026-07-25-relationship-assertion-release-migration.md)
  defines the Rulespec release, Spicy Regs pin, backfill, and rollback order.
- The [v2 reviewer runbook](superpowers/specs/2026-07-25-relation-exclusion-v2-reviewer-runbook.md)
  provides the short operator checklist for the two blind reviews.
- The initial Rulespec feedback (`RULESPEC_FEEDBACK_ITERATION_1.md` at the
  repository root), [initial corpus report](ontology-friction-report.md), and
  [stabilization report](rulespec-repair-report.md) are historical evidence
  pinned to earlier contracts.
- The [edge-coverage findings](corpus-edge-coverage-findings-2026-07-24.md)
  track open Spicy Regs extraction work discovered during the historical graph
  spike.

> Coverage notes: `sam_entities` covers the active public registry (~885K rows;

## How to query it

=== "AI assistant (MCP)"

    The hosted MCP server exposes `list_sources`, `describe_table`, and
    `query_sql` over the tables currently published above. The nine ontology
    tables appear only after their first complete generation. Add
    `https://mcp.spicy-regs.dev/mcp` as a connector, or run it locally:

    ```bash
    claude mcp add spicy-regs -- uvx --from "spicy-regs @ git+https://github.com/civictechdc/spicy-regs" spicy-regs-mcp
    ```

=== "CLI"

    ```bash
    uvx --from "spicy-regs @ git+https://github.com/civictechdc/spicy-regs" spicy-regs download
    uv run spicy-regs stats
    ```

=== "DuckDB (SQL)"

    ```sql
    INSTALL httpfs; LOAD httpfs;
    SELECT agency_code, COUNT(*) AS dockets
    FROM read_parquet('https://data.spicy-regs.dev/dockets.parquet')
    GROUP BY agency_code
    ORDER BY dockets DESC
    LIMIT 20;
    ```

=== "Python"

    ```python
    import duckdb
    con = duckdb.connect()
    con.execute("INSTALL httpfs; LOAD httpfs")
    con.execute(
        "SELECT agency_code, docket_count "
        "FROM read_parquet('https://data.spicy-regs.dev/agency_stats.parquet') "
        "ORDER BY docket_count DESC LIMIT 20"
    ).df()   # -> pandas DataFrame
    ```

    See **[Querying with Python](querying-python.md)** for a full walkthrough,
    including cross-source joins (RIN, UEI) and working with the large
    `comments` table.

!!! note "Keeping this current"
    Column names and types are the source of truth in code
    (`RECORD_TYPES` for the core tables, `DERIVED_SCHEMAS` for the rollups). The
    prose lives in `data_dictionary/descriptions.yaml`. Run
    `uv run spicy-regs-dict generate` to rebuild the table pages, and
    `uv run spicy-regs-dict check` to verify the two are in sync — the same
    check runs in CI on every pull request.
