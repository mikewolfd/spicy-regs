## Unreleased local candidate

This candidate is not published, released, or deployed.

- RINs identify durable regulatory agenda items; evidence-qualified
  relationships connect those items to independently identified Proceedings.
- Two new ontology outputs carry agenda items and their Proceeding
  relationships.
- Official Supreme Court PDF opinion packages add a seventeenth ontology
  subject profile without inferring authored-opinion boundaries from PDF layout.
- The source-aware document segmentation, dense and sparse retrieval, hybrid
  fusion, cross-encoder reranking, and scoped OpenAI tagging pipeline completed
  its bounded comparison-ready milestone. Broader production certification,
  oMLX evaluation, and extended reranker sweeps remain deferred.

## 2026-07-22

This cycle expanded the dataset from a regulations.gov + Federal Register mirror
into a broader federal-data corpus: **ten new complementary sources** now ship
as their own tables, covering the rulemaking lifecycle, the organizations that
engage in it, and its downstream context.

!!! note "New tables"
    Every table below is published as `https://data.spicy-regs.dev/<name>.parquet`
    and documented under **Tables** in the nav.

### Changed

- Made the R2 parquet corpus **edge-cacheable** and pruned docket scans ([#124](https://github.com/civictechdc/spicy-regs/pull/124)).
- **SAM.gov:** full-coverage ingestion via a partitioned walk ([#141](https://github.com/civictechdc/spicy-regs/pull/141)).
- **OpenFEC:** keyset pagination to walk all committees ([#136](https://github.com/civictechdc/spicy-regs/pull/136)).
- **Unified Agenda:** fetch and parse the real `REGINFO_RIN_DATA` XML export ([#131](https://github.com/civictechdc/spicy-regs/pull/131)).
- **CFR:** use the GovInfo `/published` endpoint and derive section fields from IDs ([#130](https://github.com/civictechdc/spicy-regs/pull/130)).
- **Congress.gov:** drop the always-null `policy_area` ([#129](https://github.com/civictechdc/spicy-regs/pull/129)).
- **CI:** weekly comments-catalog compaction with serialized writers ([#145](https://github.com/civictechdc/spicy-regs/pull/145)); forward `SAM_API_KEY` to rollup jobs ([#140](https://github.com/civictechdc/spicy-regs/pull/140)).
- **Docs:** Python query walkthrough ([#142](https://github.com/civictechdc/spicy-regs/pull/142)) and refreshed table catalog ([#139](https://github.com/civictechdc/spicy-regs/pull/139)).

### Fixed

- Hardened the external-source rollups ([#147](https://github.com/civictechdc/spicy-regs/pull/147)).
- Dedup the catalog comments view on read ([#143](https://github.com/civictechdc/spicy-regs/pull/143)).
- Sub-batch catalog dedup by key hash to avoid runner OOM ([#123](https://github.com/civictechdc/spicy-regs/pull/123)).
- Matrix sweep + full agency coverage to stop batch starvation ([#121](https://github.com/civictechdc/spicy-regs/pull/121)).
- Stop marking failed downloads as processed in the ETL manifest ([#120](https://github.com/civictechdc/spicy-regs/pull/120)).
