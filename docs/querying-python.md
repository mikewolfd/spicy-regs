# Querying with Python

Spicy Regs publishes public Apache Parquet — **no credentials or bulk download
required**. Most tables live at
`https://data.spicy-regs.dev/<table>.parquet`. The nine related ontology tables
resolve through one atomic materialized-generation manifest. The easiest query
engine is [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org) with `httpfs`, which reads only the
remote byte ranges a query needs.

```bash
pip install duckdb "spicy-regs @ git+https://github.com/civictechdc/spicy-regs"
```

## Setup

```python
import duckdb
from spicy_regs.published import (
    MATERIALIZED_TABLES,
    resolve_materialized_table_urls,
)

con = duckdb.connect()
con.execute("INSTALL httpfs; LOAD httpfs")

BASE = "https://data.spicy-regs.dev"
_materialized_urls = None

def table(name: str) -> str:
    """Return a read_parquet(...) expression for a published table."""
    global _materialized_urls
    if name in MATERIALIZED_TABLES:
        if _materialized_urls is None:
            _materialized_urls = resolve_materialized_table_urls(BASE)
        url = _materialized_urls[name]
    else:
        url = f"{BASE}/{name}.parquet"
    return f"read_parquet('{url}')"
```

Resolving the materialized pointer once per session keeps every ontology-table
join on one generation. The hosted MCP server applies the same rule. Until the
first production ontology generation is published, calls for those nine
tables fail rather than falling back to unrelated root objects.

## Query a single table

```python
# Row count
con.execute(f"SELECT count(*) FROM {table('dockets')}").fetchone()
# -> (276326,)

# A few sample rows
con.execute(f"SELECT docket_id, agency_code, title FROM {table('dockets')} LIMIT 5").fetchall()
```

!!! tip
    Add a `LIMIT` while exploring. DuckDB pushes filters and projections down to
    the remote file, so `SELECT a, b ... WHERE ... LIMIT n` is cheap even on the
    multi-hundred-thousand-row tables.

## Filter and aggregate

```python
# Busiest agencies, straight from the pre-aggregated rollup
con.execute(f"""
    SELECT agency_code, docket_count, comment_count
    FROM {table('agency_stats')}
    ORDER BY comment_count DESC
    LIMIT 10
""").fetchall()

# Most recent Federal Register documents
con.execute(f"""
    SELECT document_number, document_type, publication_date, title
    FROM {table('federal_register')}
    ORDER BY publication_date DESC
    LIMIT 10
""").fetchall()
```

## Results as a DataFrame

DuckDB converts a result set to pandas or polars in one call:

```python
df = con.execute(f"""
    SELECT agency_code, comment_count
    FROM {table('agency_stats')}
    ORDER BY comment_count DESC
    LIMIT 20
""").df()            # pandas DataFrame  (use .pl() for polars, .arrow() for Arrow)
```

## Join across sources

The complementary tables share a few keys, so you can follow a rulemaking across
its whole lifecycle and out to the organizations involved.

### Organizations → federal funding (`uei`)

`sam_entities` (the entity registry) and `usaspending_recipients` (federal award
recipients) both carry the **Unique Entity ID**:

```python
con.execute(f"""
    SELECT s.legal_business_name, s.state, u.total_award_amount
    FROM {table('sam_entities')} s
    JOIN {table('usaspending_recipients')} u USING (uei)
    ORDER BY TRY_CAST(u.total_award_amount AS DOUBLE) DESC
    LIMIT 10
""").fetchall()
```

### Planned action → published rule (`rin`)

`unified_agenda` is keyed by **RIN**; `federal_register` carries RINs in a JSON
array column, so unnest it to join:

```python
con.execute(f"""
    WITH fr_rins AS (
        SELECT DISTINCT rin
        FROM {table('federal_register')},
             UNNEST(CAST(regulation_id_numbers_json AS VARCHAR[])) AS t(rin)
        WHERE publication_date >= '2025-01-01'
    )
    SELECT ua.rin, ua.title, ua.rule_stage
    FROM {table('unified_agenda')} ua
    JOIN fr_rins USING (rin)
    LIMIT 10
""").fetchall()
# -> [('2120-AA64', 'Airworthiness Directives', ...), ...]
```

### Docket → its documents (`docket_id`)

```python
con.execute(f"""
    SELECT d.title, doc.document_type, doc.posted_date
    FROM {table('dockets')} d
    JOIN {table('documents')} doc USING (docket_id)
    WHERE d.docket_id = 'EPA-HQ-OAR-2021-0317'
    ORDER BY doc.posted_date
""").fetchall()
```

## Comments (the large one)

`comments` is tens of millions of rows. Reading the whole thing isn't the way
in — there are two better options depending on what you need.

For **counts by agency**, read the tiny `comments_index` rollup instead of
scanning the full table:

```python
con.execute(f"""
    SELECT agency_code, SUM(row_count) AS comments
    FROM {table('comments_index')}
    GROUP BY agency_code
    ORDER BY comments DESC
    LIMIT 5
""").fetchall()
# -> [('FWS', 2629148), ('FDA', 1801740), ('CMS', 1420828), ('EPA', 1133975), ('HHS', 1108090)]
```

For **rows**, `comments` is also published Hive-partitioned by agency, one
Parquet file per agency, rebuilt daily — `comments/agency/agency_code={X}/part-0.parquet`.
Point `read_parquet` at the single file for the agency you want and filter the
rest with a normal `WHERE`:

```python
con.execute(f"""
    SELECT comment_id, posted_date, title
    FROM read_parquet('{BASE}/comments/agency/agency_code=EPA/part-0.parquet')
    WHERE docket_id = 'EPA-HQ-OAR-2021-0317'
    ORDER BY posted_date
    LIMIT 20
""").fetchall()
```

!!! warning "Wildcards don't work over this endpoint"
    R2's public HTTP endpoint doesn't support object listing, so DuckDB has no
    way to expand a glob like `.../agency_code=EPA/**/*.parquet` — it 404s.
    Globs only work over `s3://` with R2 credentials (a maintainer-only path,
    since listing needs the R2 API, not plain HTTPS). Over `https://`, always
    give `read_parquet` one concrete file — here, that's the one file per
    agency — and filter with `WHERE` instead of relying on path expansion.

!!! note "An older, abandoned partition tree also exists"
    R2 still has a second, older comments tree at
    `comments/agency_code={A}/docket_id={D}/year={Y}/month={M}/part-0.parquet`.
    It stopped being written when comments moved onto the Iceberg catalog
    (its newest known file dates to May 2026) and it only ever carried 12
    columns — missing `first_name`, `last_name`, `organization`, `category`,
    `text_content`, and `text_extraction_status`. Don't build new queries
    against it.

    **`comments_index.parquet` cannot be used to enumerate it.** The index is
    rebuilt daily from the Iceberg catalog, not from this partition tree, so
    it now lists many `(agency_code, docket_id, year, month)` combinations
    that describe catalog contents with no corresponding file underneath —
    reading one of those paths 404s. `comments_index` is still the right way
    to get **counts** (as above); it's just not a file listing for this tree.

## Other ways in

- **Bundled CLI (local files):** `uvx --from "spicy-regs @ git+https://github.com/civictechdc/spicy-regs" spicy-regs download` then `spicy-regs stats` / `sample` / `search`.
- **AI assistants (MCP):** the hosted server at `https://mcp.spicy-regs.dev/mcp` exposes `list_sources` / `describe_table` / `query_sql`. See the [home page](index.md#how-to-query-it).
- **Full schemas:** every column of every table is documented under [The tables](index.md#the-tables).
