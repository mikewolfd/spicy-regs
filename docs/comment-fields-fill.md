# Fill the comment fields a row predates

Owner decision, 2026-09-28: re-read every Mirrulations comment object once
(option a) and fill what existing `comments` rows lack. The ETL cannot do it:
it replaces a catalog row only when the source `modify_date` moves, and its
manifest skips keys it already read. So a column added to the extract never
reaches rows read before it existed. That is why these are NULL:

- the four comment-reference columns, on all but a few rows;
- `subtype` and `duplicate_comments`, new in SpicyDocs 0.52.0;
- `attachments_json`, wherever the row was read before 2026-03-15, when the
  extract first mapped comment attachments (`9a5955e`). The receipt
  `comments-full-reread-2026-09-28/attachments-root-cause/prove.json` shows
  it on the 5,945-object sample. For all 896 sampled rows that lack
  attachments the source lists, the plain key's object has them, the current
  extract maps them, and the row's `modify_date` equals the object's. None
  was posted after 2026-03-10. Refetch copies were not the cause: no sampled
  comment has attachments only in a `(n)` copy.

The same read seeds `comment_attributes`.

Owner decision, 2026-10-03: read the archive again (record shape `s3`,
below) so that `attachments_json` lists every attachment the publisher
lists, withheld ones included (SpicyDocs b19b092), and replace a held list
the new read only adds to. Sizing:
`mcp-chaos-2026-10-02/round5/reread-sizing.md`.

## Commands

All run through `uv run --frozen fill-comment-fields …` (locally,
`/opt/homebrew/bin/uv`). The live write runs on a GitHub runner, through
`.github/workflows/fill-comment-fields.yml` (below).

| Step | Command | Touches the catalog |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Plan | `plan --workdir W --manifest manifest.parquet` | no |
| Read | `read --workdir W --shard i --shards n` (`run_read.zsh` runs eight) | no |
| Stage | `stage --workdir W --out D [--profile P]` (the staged read) | no |
| Upload | `upload-staged --out D` | no |
| Fetch | `fetch --workdir W --key K --sha256 H` (the staged read) | no |
| Journals | `journals --workdir W --prefix P [--push]` | no |
| Prepare | `prepare --workdir W [--reads F] [--profile P] [--docket D \| --agency A]` | reads one snapshot |
| Write | `write --workdir W [--no-by-file] [--clear-failure]` | writes, under the lock |
| Undo | `undo --workdir W --batch B --expected-snapshot S` | writes, under the lock |
| Seed attributes | `attributes --workdir W` | no |

**Plan** splits the ETL manifest's comment keys into 20,000-key chunks per
agency. A plan is named by the manifest digest and the record shape, so a
newer manifest adds only the keys since and a new shape is a new plan. The
shape is `s3` since 2026-10-03: `attachments_json` as SpicyDocs b19b092
extracts it. The 2026-09-28 parts are `s2`. `plan` and `read` refuse to run
under a SpicyDocs that drops withheld attachments, since its `s3` parts
would hold `s2`'s values.

**Read** writes one part per chunk. Each part row holds:

- the object key, and the GET's ETag and size;
- the extract's thin row, with the body kept as its SHA-256 and length;
- `attributes_json`: every other stated attribute, non-null only.

A part is written whole or not at all, so a rerun reads only the missing
chunks. Transport failures leave a chunk unwritten; unreadable or empty
objects are journaled. Each process stops cleanly past `--max-rss-mb`, or
before a chunk when the disk has less than `--min-free-gb`.

**The staged read.** A runner cannot see the parts, so one fill-only Parquet
file carries what `prepare` reads of them for one profile
(`read_columns(profile)`): each copy's object key, `comment_id`,
`modify_date` and the profile's fill columns.

- `all` (the default): every column of the table a part holds
  (`FILL_COLUMNS`), the submitter's name, organization and category among
  them.
- `attachments`: `attachments_json` alone, for the 2026-10 re-read.

`stage` builds it from this shape's parts, every read copy a row. It holds no
attribute JSON (email, phone, fax), no ETag or size, and no body digest:
every column but the key goes public in `comments` anyway, which is why it
may sit in the data bucket. `stage` checks the written file against the
parts with DuckDB and with Arrow, and removes it on any failure. It writes
`reads.parquet.sha256` and `staging.json`. `upload-staged` puts both files
under `staging/comment-fields-fill-<sha12>/`, refuses a prefix that holds
anything, and reads the file back. `prepare --reads` refuses a staged read
that lacks a column of its profile, and the workflow's `profile` input must
name the profile the file was staged for. `fetch` refuses any bytes but the
named sha256. Delete the staging prefix (the file, its `.sha256` and
`journals/`, after copying the journals into the receipts) once the fill is
done.

**Prepare** reads the catalog narrowly at its current snapshot: the key,
`modify_date`, whether each fill column is NULL (the value only of
`attachments_json`, which a read may replace) and each row's data file, and
counts the table's rows. It checks the fill columns at
that snapshot and refuses if one is missing. It also refuses while any journal
holds a batch that committed and failed its check (below). Each step streams
its input into a Parquet file under `fill/work/`, outside the artifact,
removed once the receipt is written: the catalog scan, the read copies of the
comments in scope (without their object keys), and one value per version and
column (NULL where its copies disagree). It writes three files:

- `fill/fill.parquet`, holding only the values to fill, unsorted (a batch
  reads it filtered on `_file`);
- `fill/files.parquet`, each file's rows and bytes; a file whose size cannot
  be read refuses the prepare, since batches pack by size;
- a counts-only `fill/prepare.json`. Its `prepare_id` is the snapshot, the
  fill's digest and a random nonce, so a fresh prepare always starts a fresh
  journal.

A read row fills a catalog cell only when all of these hold:

- its `comment_id` and `modify_date` match the catalog row's, so a copy of
  another version is counted and skipped;
- the cell is NULL. A stated `0` is a value; unstated stays NULL;
- every copy read for that version states the same value for that column, a
  stated null counting as one spelling. A column the copies disagree on is
  listed in `fill/conflicts.parquet` and fills nothing; the others still fill.

One rule replaces a value, in `attachments_json` only (`ADDITIVE`). Under
the same version and agreement, a read replaces the held list when it only
adds to it: the read is in the extract's own spelling, and with its
renditions that have no `url`, the entries left with none and each entry's
restriction removed (`downloadable_attachments`), it equals the held value
byte for byte. That removal is exactly the rule before b19b092, so a list
read before it is replaced by the same record's full list. Any other read
list that differs from a held one is refused, counted
(`refused_not_additive_by_column`) and listed in `fill/refusals.parquet`. A
read that states no list never blanks a held one.

`prepare.json` names its profile and `columns`, and counts per column the
NULL cells filled (`cells_by_column`), the lists replaced
(`replaced_by_column`), the refusals and the conflicted versions;
`other_version_only` counts rows read only at another `modify_date`.

**Write** applies the fill in batches of whole data files, up to 512 MiB of
compressed files each. It never migrates the table and refuses if a fill
column is missing. Each batch runs in one transaction. The transaction reads
one snapshot from `BEGIN` on, and the catalog refuses its `COMMIT` (409) if
another writer committed meanwhile:

1. It checks that the catalog is still at the snapshot this fill last
   committed, and lists the live data files from the table's manifests.
2. It writes the batch's rows, as they are, to `fill/preimage/`, and journals
   the batch as `pending` with the pre-image's digest.
3. It runs one MERGE on `comment_id`, `modify_date` and `filename` that fills
   only NULL cells, and replaces a list only where the row still holds the
   value prepare read (the fill row carries it). It requires the MERGE's
   count to equal the planned count.
4. It reads the batch's rows back inside the transaction, from its old files
   and from the files the MERGE wrote, and keeps each row's key and digest in
   `fill/preimage/…-written.parquet`. The rows must equal the pre-image with
   the fill and the replacements applied, on every column; the new files must
   hold no row outside the batch; and the table must hold exactly the rows it
   held at prepare.
   DuckDB's Iceberg transaction reads its own MERGE before COMMIT
   (`bench/txn_readback.json`).

Any failure rolls back, so nothing is committed, and journals the batch as
`failed`. That stops later runs of this prepare until `--clear-failure`.

After COMMIT, the batch's snapshot must be the one child of the checked
snapshot, adding exactly the changed records and position deletes. Otherwise
the batch is journaled `failed` with `committed: true`. That stops every
`prepare` and `write`, in any journal, until the batch is undone (below) or,
after a repair by hand, cleared with `write --clear-failure`.

The journal records files, so a changed batch budget never redoes passed
work. After a crash, a `pending` batch is handled in one of three ways:

- if the catalog did not move, it is abandoned;
- if it committed (its snapshot is the child of the checked one and the counts
  match), it is checked against its stored pre-image as of its own snapshot,
  and journaled `verified`, or `failed` with `committed: true`;
- anything else stops the run.

Another commit between batches stops the run: an ETL write, a
`dedupe`, or R2's compaction. Preparing again then finds only the cells still
NULL.

## Undo a committed batch

`undo --batch B --expected-snapshot S` restores batch `B` from its pre-image
as a new commit, through `iceberg.replace_rows`, the ETL's own checked
replacement. Moving the table's ref back instead was tried and removed: after
it, DuckDB 1.5.5 still read the newer snapshot and its next write failed with
409, which would have broken every ETL run.

- `S` is the snapshot you reviewed (the journal's last `snapshot_after`, or
  the one the refusal names). The undo refuses unless the catalog is at `S`,
  both before it starts and inside its transaction.
- Every row the batch's commit wrote must still be in the table as written
  (the `-written` digests). A row changed since, by the ETL or anyone, refuses
  the whole undo, for a repair by hand.
- Only the rows the commit changed are rewritten, whole, so a damaged commit
  is undone on every column; a row it lost is inserted again.
- After COMMIT the undo's snapshot must be the one child of `S`, adding the
  restored rows. The journal gets an `undone` line, which clears that batch's
  failure. The fill's prepare is then spent: prepare again.

Rehearsed on the local Iceberg fixture
(`tests/test_comment_fields_iceberg.py`): an undo of one of three batches,
then a plain DuckDB read and the ETL's own `_merge` of a newer version and a
new comment; and a damaged commit found on recovery, refused, then undone
whole. On a runner, dispatch the workflow with `operation: undo`, the failed
run's id, the batch and `S`; it takes the pre-images from that run's artifact.

## Cost

The live table is unpartitioned and unsorted: 43 data files, 26.3M rows and
6.6 GB at 2026-09-29's snapshot (46 files the day before; R2's compaction
merges them). Most rows sit in R2's compacted files, each
spanning most agencies. DuckDB writes Iceberg merge-on-read: a MERGE never
rewrites a data file. It writes each changed row anew with a positional
delete.

- **A batch per agency** fetches every row group once per agency in it:
  O(agencies × table).
- **A batch of whole data files** is matched on `filename` too, so full rows
  are fetched only from its own files. A `filename` filter prunes no file,
  though: every scan still opens every data file and reads its key and file
  columns. So each batch reads those narrow columns of the whole table a fixed
  number of times (the pre-image, the MERGE, the read-back and one count):
  O(table) per batch and O(batches × table) in all, bounded by packing whole
  files up to 512 MiB.

Measured on live, read-only, at one pinned snapshot, from a laptop under
load (2026-09-29, receipts `write-review/live-timing/`). The table packs into
15 batches of 1–5 files and 270–508 MiB, 6.1 GiB in all. Per batch, for the
one with the most bytes (4 files, 4.5M rows) and the one with the most rows
(5 files, 5.5M rows):

| Step | 4.5M rows | 5.5M rows |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The live file list, from the manifests | 3.7 s | 3.7 s |
| The pre-image, streamed to disk (~0.5 GB) | 20.7 s | 27.6 s |
| The MERGE's read side (full rows, key and file match) | 21.1 s | 23.0 s |
| The row count and strays, one scan | 7.8 s | 1.0 s |
| The read-back digests and their comparison | 12.4 s | 14.9 s |

Comparing whole rows took 206–301 s per batch, so the check compares each
row's key and digest instead. The MERGE's write side (the batch's rows anew,
about 0.5 GB, plus position deletes) cannot be measured read-only.

`prepare` against the live catalog (snapshot 3006217674017424405, 26,415,400
rows) and the 18-column staged read (`f9d5d7c2…`), read-only from a laptop on
2026-10-03, under `WRITE_RESOURCES` (6 GB, 4 threads):

| Code | Budget | Outcome | Wall | Peak RSS | Peak spill |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| bde43c0 (three in-memory temp tables) | 6 GB | out of memory at `_versions` | 126 s | 9.9 GB | 13.9 GB (cap) |
| streamed intermediates, unsorted fill | 6 GB | 17,341,368 rows to fill | 165 s | 9.1 GB | 7.6 GB |
| streamed intermediates, unsorted fill | 3 GB | the same rows | 169 s | 6.5 GB | 12.3 GB |

The runner's run of bde43c0 (37105894011) ran out of its 6 GB at the fill's
COPY after 11 minutes; locally, with the temp directory capped at 15 GB to
spare the disk, it failed one step earlier. Peak RSS is macOS's maximum
resident size, above the DuckDB budget; spill was sampled every 10 s. The
three outputs above hold the same rows, and on FDA alone bde43c0 and the
streamed code wrote the same fill, files and counts (1,081,203 rows; peak RSS
7.3 GB and 3.0 GB). Under-budget runs spill to `fill/spill`, which is
`/mnt` on the runner.

The projection, scaled by rows (the MERGE and the check cost by row, the
pre-image by byte): about 255 s of pre-images, 116 s of MERGE reads, 71 s of
read-back, and 14 s of counting and 4 s of file listing per batch. That is
about 12 minutes of reading under the lock for all 15 batches on the laptop.
A runner scans the whole table in 0.85–1.11× the laptop's time (the mirror's
staging scan: 338 s and 439 s on runners, 396 s on the laptop), so about
10–13 minutes there. The MERGEs' writes, about 6.3 GB of new data files plus
position deletes, come on top; they are not measured. The run also holds the
group for `prepare` (about 2 minutes) and the artifact upload.

The runner has room: the check keeps digests, not whole rows. Comparing
whole rows spilled 42 GB per dense batch, more than a runner's disk.

## Running it on a GitHub runner

The owner's decision, 2026-09-29: the fill runs on a runner, one dispatch of
`fill-comment-fields.yml` at a time. The workflow joins the catalog writers'
concurrency group `comments-catalog-write`, so the ETL, the mirror, the dedupe
and the backfills queue behind it, and sets `SPICY_REGS_CATALOG_LOCK`. Each
run:

1. fetches the staged read and checks its sha256;
2. pulls every earlier run's journal from the staging prefix's `journals/`,
   so a committed failure from any run stops this one;
3. disables R2's compaction for the table and confirms it at table level
   (the catalog-level setting alone does not show a table override);
4. runs `prepare`, then `write` (or `undo`);
5. always pushes the journals back, uploads the journal, receipts and
   pre-images as the run's artifact `comment-fields-fill`, and re-enables
   compaction.

The staged read for this fill (2026-09-29, receipt
`comments-full-reread-2026-09-28/staging/staging.json`): key
`staging/comment-fields-fill-405b55d1c112/reads.parquet`, sha256
`405b55d1c1128d5f031b9b6a1fa5b7381208ea6e453eab45ccd2b50c4ff4bc96`,
179,560,661 bytes, 26,629,661 read copies of 26,314,480 comments. Its
journals go to `staging/comment-fields-fill-405b55d1c112/journals/`.

Order of dispatches:

1. `operation: prepare`: counts only, no write. Review its `prepare.json`
   (in the artifact): `rows_to_fill`, `cells_by_column`, the conflicts.
2. `operation: pilot` with `pilot_docket: EPA-HQ-OW-2022-0114`: one scoped
   batch. Check the docket's rows in the catalog.
3. `operation: fill`.
4. If a batch is journaled `failed` with `committed: true`, stop and undo it
   (above) before anything else.

The next mirror publication carries the filled rows.

## The 2026-10 re-read (`attachments`)

Read, stage, then fill, each step after the last has finished:

1. **Read**, on a workstation, with no lock. Use a branch that vendors the
   SpicyDocs release carrying b19b092 (`plan` refuses any other), deployed to
   the ETL first so that rows ingested meanwhile get the same rule. Use a
   fresh workdir: the 2026-09-28 one holds `s2` parts and logs.
   `plan --workdir W --manifest <current manifest.parquet>`, then
   `read --workdir W --shard i --shards 8` for each shard (the 2026-09-28
   receipts' `run_read.zsh` runs eight and retries; point its `cd` and `R` at
   the branch and `W`). That is about 26.7M unsigned GETs to the public
   bucket, about 76 GB and 3–4 hours. A shard that exits 3 resumes on rerun.
2. **Stage**: `stage --workdir W --out W/staging-attachments --profile attachments`,
   then `upload-staged --out W/staging-attachments`. Copy `staging.json` into
   the receipts.
3. **Fill**, on a runner: dispatch `fill-comment-fields.yml` with
   `profile: attachments`, the upload's `staging_key` and `reads_sha256`, in
   this order: `prepare` (review `replaced_by_column`, the refusals, the
   conflicts and `other_version_only`), then `pilot` on a docket with withheld
   attachments (EPA-HQ-OW-2022-0114 lists 58 entries in 16 records), then
   `fill`.

Cautions:

- Dispatch only after the 18-column fill has finished and its staging prefix
  is deleted.
- `comments-catalog-write` holds one running and one pending run; a third
  dispatch cancels the pending one. Check `gh run list` first and dispatch
  one step at a time, clear of the 06:25Z sweep (about 3 hours; it checks out
  `main` at start) and the 18:25Z retry.
- An ETL commit between batches stops the fill: prepare again. The workflow
  re-enables compaction at the end; confirm it did.

## Preconditions

1. This branch is deployed with its SpicyDocs release.
2. The catalog has the new columns: the first ETL data commit after the
   deploy adds them (`_connect_for_table`'s ALTERs). `prepare` checks for them.
3. At least one ETL data commit has landed since.

## Holding the lock locally

Only if the fill must run from a workstation. A local process cannot join the
concurrency group, so it excludes the other writers by hand:

1. `gh workflow disable` each workflow in `comments-catalog-write` that has a
   schedule or can be dispatched (`etl-new-pipeline.yml` with
   `_regulations-refresh.yml` and `_comments-mirror.yml`,
   `publish-comments-mirror.yml`, `dedupe-comments-catalog.yml`,
   `backfill-comment-attachment-text.yml`, `check-comments-freshness.yml`,
   `fill-comment-fields.yml`). Confirm none has a run queued or in progress
   (`gh run list --workflow <file> --status in_progress`, then `--status
   queued`).
2. Disable compaction for the table
   (`npx wrangler r2 bucket catalog compaction disable spicy-regs default comments`)
   and confirm it at table level, read-only:
   `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $(npx wrangler auth token)" https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/<account>/r2-catalog/spicy-regs/namespaces/default/tables/comments/maintenance-configs`
   must show `result.maintenance_config.compaction.state` `disabled`
   (2026-09-29: `enabled`, hourly, 128 MB; at catalog level snapshot expiry
   is disabled, leave it so).
3. `export SPICY_REGS_CATALOG_LOCK=local-fill-<UTC time>`. `write` and `undo`
   refuse without it.
4. Prepare, pilot and fill as on the runner. Every batch also refuses if the
   snapshot moved, which catches a writer the steps above missed.
5. Re-enable compaction
   (`npx wrangler r2 bucket catalog compaction enable spicy-regs default comments --target-size 128`),
   then the workflows.

## Seeding `comment_attributes`

`attributes --workdir W` projects every read copy's `attributes_json` through
SpicyDocs' `project_comment_attributes`. It keeps one row per comment by the
ETL's own copy rule: newest `modifyDate`, then the smallest digest, here the
object's ETag. It skips reviewed exclusions by the ETL's own content check,
and writes `W/comment_attributes.parquet` and `W/attribute_refusals.json`.

Until the working copy exists, each ETL run drops its comment attribute rows
with a warning. So seed it while the ETL is paused:

1. `plan` the current manifest; this adds only the keys since the read.
2. `read` them.
3. Run `attributes`.
4. Upload `comment_attributes.parquet` as the working copy.
5. Run `run-rollup-comment-attributes`.
6. Deploy the matching ETL and `_regulations-refresh.yml`, whose base families include that command.

Only then re-enable the workflows. From then on, the scheduled ETL's comment
passes merge their rows into the working copy, like `document_attributes`. The
chunked manual path stages none: a crash between its per-chunk checkpoints
would lose rows.
