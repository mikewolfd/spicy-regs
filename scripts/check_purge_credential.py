"""Watchdog for the Cloudflare cache-purge credential.

Purges are best-effort by design: ``purge_urls`` logs a warning and returns, so
a broken credential never fails a publish that already wrote its data. That is
correct for the publish and blind for observability. When the purge token
lapsed on 2026-08-17 every rollup across the repo kept reporting ``success``
for twelve days while no invalidation happened anywhere — the only trace was a
warning line buried in each run's log.

This is the check that looks. It runs in the nightly freshness workflow and
fails it, so a dead or expiring credential surfaces the next morning through
the notification path the repo already has, instead of waiting for someone to
read a log.

Missing credentials are a failure, not a skip: an unset token is exactly the
state where ``purge_urls`` silently no-ops, which is the gap being closed. Pass
``--allow-unconfigured`` for local runs with no Cloudflare setup.
