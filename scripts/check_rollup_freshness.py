"""Check published tables for stale watermarks and stalled growth.

Covers both the base tables the daily ETL publishes (``dockets``, ``documents``)
and the external-source rollups. Date-backed sources are checked against
source-appropriate age budgets. Sources without a meaningful update date are
either tracked by row-count change (``usaspending_recipients``) or explicitly
skipped with a reason. The state file lets the daily workflow remember when a row
count last changed.
