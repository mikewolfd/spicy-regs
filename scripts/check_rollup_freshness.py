"""Check published tables for stale watermarks and stalled growth.

Covers both the base tables the daily ETL publishes (``dockets``, ``documents``)
and the external-source rollups. Date-backed sources are checked against
source-appropriate age budgets. Sources without a meaningful update date are
tracked by row-count change (``usaspending_recipients``) or checked against their
publication metadata without a date-age rule. The state file lets the daily
workflow remember when a row count last changed.

One publication snapshot selects all inputs. Remote column scans check managed
members against their declared schemas and row counts. This monitor does not
download or hash whole files: the publisher and CLI own byte-pin verification.
Tables outside the index keep the legacy remote column-read path.

The comment corpus gets a coverage check instead of a date watermark: per-agency
row counts from ``comments_index.parquet``, compared with the last known-good
counts in the state file (see :func:`evaluate_comment_coverage`).
