"""Audit and remove duplicate rows from the Iceberg ``comments`` catalog table.

The one-time seed that loaded the pre-existing R2 partition tree into the catalog
duplicated rows for agencies that were loaded more than once — its per-agency
``DELETE`` did not remove prior rows on the R2 Data Catalog, so re-loads
accumulated exact copies (e.g. OMB ~2.5x, NARA ~3.8x; FWS/EPA/DOT clean).

The daily merge is affected by the *same* unreliable ``DELETE`` (see
``iceberg._merge``), just at a far smaller scale: only comment_ids that are
re-merged — a comment whose ``modify_date`` advanced, or a key re-staged by the
redundant sweep — can leave their old row behind, so a handful of near-1.00x
duplicates trickle in per run. The read surface hides them (``mcp_server`` dedups
the ``comments`` view on read); this job is how the physical rows are reclaimed,
so it is worth re-running periodically, not only after the seed.

Default mode is a **read-only audit**: it reports every agency whose row count
exceeds its distinct ``comment_id`` count, plus totals. Nothing is written.

``--apply`` rebuilds the table deduplicated (one row per ``comment_id``, latest
``modify_date``): it writes a fresh sibling table **one agency at a time**, then
replaces the live table with it via ``DROP`` + per-agency ``INSERT`` (DuckDB's
Iceberg REST integration does not support ``ALTER TABLE RENAME``). It never uses
``DELETE`` (the operation that left the duplicates) and never rewrites the whole
table in one statement (which OOMs the runner on both the read and Iceberg-write
sides) — only bounded per-agency writes. The sibling is kept until the rebuilt
table's row count is verified, so an interrupted swap loses nothing and re-running
resumes it. After a successful apply, re-run the mirror
(``publish_comments_mirror.py``) so the public files the UI reads are refreshed.

Safe rollout: run with no flags first (audit), eyeball the report, then ``--apply``,
then run once more with no flags to confirm the table is clean.

Reads/writes the catalog via ``R2_CATALOG_*``. See
``.github/workflows/dedupe-comments-catalog.yml``.

Usage:
    uv run python scripts/dedupe_comments_catalog.py            # audit only (default)
    uv run python scripts/dedupe_comments_catalog.py --apply    # rebuild deduplicated
